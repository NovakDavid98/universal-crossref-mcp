Bubbles whirling in the substance of water have form. Their form is but an attribute of their whirling motion and is not of the substance of water. When the motion ceases form disappears, but the substance remains. Creation is merely a swing of the cosmic pendulum from inertia, through, energy, and back again to inertia, forever and forever. It is but a series of opposing pulsations of action and reaction, integration and disintegration, gravitation and radiation, appearance and disappearance. The One universal Mind is a formless, thinking substance. If the One substance were not a thinking substance, that which man calls creation would not have been. That which man calls God is an ecstatic thinking substance, thinking in continuity, thinking rhythmically, thinking with orderly variation of intensity in measurable impulses throughout endless ages, in endless space. Thinking is an action which is the cause of all motion. It is a process, a purely mechanical process, periodic in its evolution through one cycle after another without end. The process of thinking leaves the evidence of that process behind it, registering the effect of its passage through the Ocean of the universal Mind. In its wake are myriads of rotating particles of the One substance which register the thinking of Mind, just as in the wake of an ocean steamer are myriads of tiny rotating bubbles which register the passage of that steamer. The many bubbles in the wake of the steamer produce an effect of foam in the ocean's substance which appears to be different from the surrounding substance. It is the same substance but of less stability. The whirling bubbles of foam owe their appearance of stability to motion. When the motion ceases the bubbles will disappear. The wake of the steamer is an appearance which we know will disappear. It has no stability. It has only an appearance of stability. The bubbles are apparently separate individuals possessing form and motion which are apparently their own, but which we know are not their own. Their appearance of separateness we know is but an illusion due to force and motion. When the churning effect of the propeller has been dissipated, foam, bubbles, wake and all will disappear into the mighty ocean of which they are a part, and from which they have never been separated. The passage of all thought through the tranquil ocean of universal Mind may well be likened unto the passage of big boats and little boats and all the winds of heaven upon the tranquil ocean of waters. Page 30 Page 31 The passage of all these forces leave their effects in appearance upon the ocean of waters, registering thereon in foam the idea of those forces. Without the exertion of these forces upon the tranquil waters, an absolute uniformity of appearance would prevail throughout the ocean of waters. Without the force of thinking throughout the tranquil substance of Mind, there would be no appearance of variability whatsoever in the universe of Mind. There would be no form. The distinct spiral nebula of Perseus or the trail of the Milky Way looming against the Ocean of Mind is exactly analogous to the foamy wake of a steamer as viewed from a great height. Both the wake of the steamer and the nebula of Perseus are appearances due to the passage of ponderous ideas, and both will disappear back into the substance of which they are a part. The myriad whirling spheres of the nebula, its integrating suns and solar system, its planets and moons, its asteroids and meteorites are all whirling forms born of the churning propeller of the One Mind thinking out this universe of ours. Similarly the whirling spheres of the steamer's wake, with its big bubbles, its lesser bubbles and its milky foam, are a line of white against the deep blue sea, but not separate from the sea in substance. The temperature in the wake of the steamer is higher than that of the surrounding water. Similarly the temperature of the spiral nebula is higher than that of the surrounding "ether" matter, because of the heat energy generated by thinking and transferred to the whirling spheres. The law governing both bubbles and nebula is the same. The difference between them is only relative in point of time. Both disappear when they cease to whirl, for their appearance of existence is due solely to the heat energy of motion. A bubble may whirl for a few moments and a sun for a hundred billion years before their generated heat becomes radiated into their father-mother substance which gave them birth. The difference in time is but relative, for time is nothing in eternity. When the bubbles have radiated their heat to the temperature of the surrounding water, they cease all appearance of individual existence. Their forms have disappeared with cessation of motion, but their substance is as existent as the ocean is existent. When giant suns have radiated their heat to the absolute zero of the surrounding ether substance of Mind, they cease all appearance of individual existence. Their forms have disappeared with the cessation of motion, but their substance is as eternal as Mind is eternal. Page 32 CONTENTS CHAPTER IV THINKING MIND The process of thinking is a simple one. It is a swing of the cosmic pendulum from the stability of Mind substance to apparent instability and back again to stability. The registration of this effect in the ocean of universal Mind is contained within the form of an elongated sphere, and all its variability and complexity may be read upon two exactly opposite spiral waves within two halves of that sphere. Light, heat, electricity, magnetism, form, crystallization, sound, mass, the elements and compounds of elements, time, space, attraction, gravitation, force, energy, inertia, sex, life, death, sleep, memory, the souls of all things and the complex ideas of all things, in fact, all that man can comprehend of this universe, can be spelled out, in their beginnings, on these two opposing spiral waves within one sphere, and on through to their endings in nine other increasingly larger though flattening spheres, or ellipsoids. These two opposing spiral waves within one sphere represent the entire simple process of thinking, but not the entire variability of the effect of thinking They represent the beginning or highest octave in the cycle of thinking, of which there are ten. The simple process of thinking is repeated exactly in the ten octaves, but with periodic variability and complexity of registered effect. All variability and complexity of registered effect is orderly in variation and complication; and thus are all effects comprehensible to that man who has knowledge of the cause of those effects. Everywhere throughout its entirety the Mind substance is in constant agitation, undergoing the orderly process of thinking. The force called "thinking" which impels Mind into concentration and decentration in sequence is the only energy of the universe. There is no other energy. The universe is Mind only. The universal constant of energy registers, in the substance of Mind, the illusions caused by the thinking of Mind. Every microscopic point in divine Mind becomes the center of the universe of Mind, with its first impulse of the act of thinking; for with this .first impulse is form born into a universe which is without form. From that center the explosive-reactive, genera-radiative, electro-magnetic disturbance which constitutes the process of thinking, reproduces itself throughout the entirety of the universe at incomprehensible speed in waves of creating light units, which waves return again to that exact center. Thinking is an action followed by a reaction of that action. The action of thinking constitutes a series of events in sequence. The intervals between events in sequence constitute that effect of motion called "time." Without a sequence of events time could not be for there would be nothing to mark time. Time begins with the action of thinking. It is an effect which appears with motion-inopposition and disappears into motion-in-inertia. Page 33 The events in sequence which give birth to that appearance called "time," are the opposing pulsations of generative and radiative light. These opposing pulsations give dimension and form to that which man calls "life." To man there is no life without form. Form and dimension are fleeting. Life is eternal. Life is merely the action of thinking; and thinking is as eternal as the thinking substance of Mind is eternal. Universal thinking is rhythmic thinking. The entire substance of universal Mind is thinking in varying but orderly rhythmic meter. The meter of universal thinking is measurable in its orderliness throughout the entirety of the universal substance. The tempo of the cosmic, rhythmic meter of thinking is absolute. All thinking is expressed in measurable and opposing impulses of opposing motion. All motion is action and reaction. Page 34 CONTENTS CHAPTER V THE PROCESS OF THINKING The action impulse and the reaction impulse of the thinking process are alternating between the apparent opposites known as generation and radiation. Generation and radiation are opposites which constitute the appearance, of motion-in-opposition. Generation is the attractive, gravitative, positive, electric force, and radiation is the repulsive, emanative, negative, magnetic force. All motion, whether in opposition or in inertia, is in equilibrium. That is to say, the amount of energy expended in any two opposite swings of the cosmic pendulum is always quantitatively constant. The apparent variation is in the dimension of the two opposing swings, and is not of the constant of energy. The amount of generative and radiative energies expended in the two opposing oscillations, anywhere in the entire ten octaves, when added together, total the same in the amount of energy expended. Motion-in-inertia is characterized by an absolute lack of what man calls "valence," which is grabbing power, or uniting power. All of the elements of matter in motion-in-opposition have this uniting power in varying degree, or periodicity, just as they have periodicity in electro-magnetic charge and other variations; hence, a further reason for disassociating the inert gases, or master-tones, from the elements. Opposing impulses of thinking are generated out of inertia and radiated back into equalization in inertia. These impulses are alternating between generation and radiation in a periodicity of preponderance, which periodicity is measurable by man in many ways. All matter is apparently evolving and devolving into the illusion of many substances of many dimensions. So-called solids of matter are variations of apparent states of motion registering in form the idea of thinking Mind, and sustained in their appearance as solids of matter by electric preponderance over magnetism. The electric nature of matter in its progressive periodicity and variation of electromagnetic charge, rotation of its light units and other periodicities, will be written down with more exactness when the process of thinking is more explicitly written down and charted. Suffice it here to say that thinking is the electro-generative action and magneto-radiative reaction of Mind. Thinking is a simple process of very complex effects, the sequence of which will be written in its proper place. The electro-magnetic opposition of Mind as expressed in the process of thinking is the source of all of the energy of the universe. Thinking, then, is a process of generation of motion-in-variable-opposition out of a state of maximum motion-in-non-variable-inertia, and of radiation back again into that state. The inertial line is that hypothetical line of absolute non-opposition between the oscillations of the two opposing forces of motion. At the inertial line the two opposing forces are neutralized and in equilibrium. At the inertial line there is no force back of motion but there is the impetus of the magnetic radiative pulsation which continues motion across the inertial line without force. Once across Page 35 the line, motion is continued by the electro-generative pulsation until magnetic conquest causes it to rebound. That state of motion which continues motion without force back of it will be known as inertial energy. The inertial line, or plane, might be characterized as the axis along which wave expressions of the universal constant of energy are born. The mechanic might characterize it as the "dead center" between force and force where no force exists. This point can only be passed by the impetus given to an object in motion prior to its arrival at: that point. Motion is continuous as thinking is continuous. The universe breathes, inhaling and exhaling as man breathes; and as every light unit, atom and molecule breathes; and as everything in the firmament above and the waters below breathes. Exhalation and inhalation, in sequence, is a characteristic of all phenomena of matter. Motion is caused by the sequence of opposing impulses of thinking. All direction of motion, and effects of motion are governed by these equally balanced gravitative and repulsive, and equally balanced decelerative and accelerative forces. The opposition of the two apparently op posing forces, which cause apparently opposite impulses, forms spiral waves along which the idea produced in thinking is registered. The registered idea of thinking is expressed gravitatively in what man calls the "elements of matter," and repulsively in what man calls the "magnetic flow" or "magnetic lines of force" in heretofore unknown magnetic orbits. All elements of matter are radiative or radioactive, just as all matter is generative, or genero-active. Electrically generating elements and magnetically radiating lines of force are the same force exerted in apparently opposite directions. The former is centripetal and its direction is toward the nucleal (center of a closing spiral. The latter is centrifugal and its direction is away from the center toward the opening spiral. Their difference is but a rising or lowering of potential. One always becomes the other. Each is the cause of the other. Radio-activity is a lowering of potential into 5 higher octaves of elements of greater speed but lesser power. Genero-activity is the increasing of potential into lower octaves of greater power and lesser speed. Genero-activity builds the elements. Radio-activity tears them apart. The elements are composed of apparently separate particles in motion which shall henceforth be called "light units" or "corpuscles." The spiral genero-radiative waves are the medium of reproduction of idea throughout the entirety of the universe. All idea of Mind produced by thinking is reproduced throughout the entirety of the universe of Mind in measurable waves of electro-magnetic opposition. These apparently opposing genero-radiative waves constitute the creating and decreating universe of integrating and disintegrating elements of potential energy which man calls the "created physical" universe. Man has measured the speed at which the energy of light appears to travel along waves as 186,400 miles per second. This measure is the highest measure of the perceptible impulses of universal thinking. This is the measure of energy reproduction which man calls the "speed of light." Page 36 Man's concept of the speed of light, as being uniform, is a wrong concept. To man, light is incandescent luminosity. Page 37 Page 38 To man that which is not glowingly incandescent is not light. All matter is light. This universe is one of light. Solids of matter, heavy, dark, and cold, are as much light as flaming Arcturus. Luminosity is but a state of intensely unequalized and opposing motion sustained in its state of unequalized motion by the generation of high pressures. It is but one state of the substance of Mind in motion, a state which is within a limited range of electro-magnetic charge, temperature, and opposition; a range which varies in intensity in each octave, but which runs the whole gamut of its limitations in the ten octave cycle. Incandescent luminosity is but the state of maximum opposition of the two apparently opposing forces, and a state in which radiative resistance to generation is at its maximum; a state in which contraction by maximum genero-active accumulation of time into Power is resisting expansion by radiative dissipation of power into time, of which much will be written in its proper place. Incandescent luminosity is that state of motion which will be known as the high potential of a system or an octave. It is the meeting place of centripetal and centrifugal forces of preponderantly male and preponderantly female, of maximum electro magnetic opposition, and it is the state of maximum registration of heat. It is the turning point where the power of electricity to generate Mind substance into the appearance of form, yields to the power of magnetism to radiate it back into the disappearance of form. Man's speed of light is the speed at which that state of motion-in-opposition, known as incandescent luminosity appears to travel through those high octaves of integrating matter which man calls "empty space, " or the "ether of space." This measure of light is but the high measure of a great range of apparent speeds. All of the elements of matter, in all states of motion, are but orderly and periodic variations of the One substance, light. As there are innumerable states of motion of the substance of light so also are there innumerable so- called "speeds" of light. All of the elements of matter are spread out progressively, in varying states of simultaneously decelerative and accelerative motion-in-opposition, on the ten octave waves, like successive tones of music. All motion-in-opposition is simultaneous in its opposition. The state of luminosity belongs to all of the elements and varies with the state of integration of each element. It is periodic and orderly in its variation as the elements are periodic and' variable in their integrative weight or mass. Matter which is apparently non-luminous is simply matter which has become sufficiently retarded generatively and sufficiently expanded radiatively to bring it below the range of motion-in-opposition which produces the appearance of luminosity. All solids of matter are but integrated light, the generative units of which are sufficiently retarded in their motion, and their resistance to integration sufficiently extended in magnetic orbits, to bring them below the range of the state of apparent luminosity. Page 39 Page 40 CONTENTS CHAPTER VI THINKING IS REGISTERED IN MATTER It has elsewhere been written that matter is the registration of the divine idea of thinking Mind. Man is familiar with the thinking process in his own daily experiences. Consider for a moment the concentrative thinking of man in conceiving idea. Is not the idea at first nebulous? And as man concentrates electrically in his thinking is not the idea more and more distinct in form? And does not that form remain clear and distinct so long as man concentrates dynamically upon thinking that idea? When man's concentration relaxes does not the idea become more and more nebulous in form, and more indistinct, until it is but a memory? Just so with the thinking of the One universal Mind. The concentration of all Mind is electro positively registered in motion and its intensity and relaxation of intensity are chemically noted in states of motion of the very Mind substance which performs the action and reaction of the thinking process. The intense 'concentrated expression of idea in generative thinking is chemically registered in definite, distinct, rigid form while the relaxed, less intense, expanding expression of idea in electro- negative, radiative - thinking is chemically registered in indefinite, indistinct, nebulous form. If the universal Mind is without form within itself, if its light units and mass are but appearances of form due to motion and not to substance, so also is Mind in its entirety without form or shape or size. The universe of Mind is neither bounded nor boundless for it has no extension or continuation. Apparent separability is a necessary quality in creating the illusion of a universe of extension or continuation. The One substance of divine Mind is non-separable, non-extendable and non-continuous. The apparent parts of Mind have an apparent relationship to one another. As the appearance of separability of the Mind substance is but an effect of motion, then also is the appearance of relationship of one apparent part to another but an illusion due to motion. Relationship of matter is but an appearance and has no existence, and that which man calls "relativity" is but an illusion, just as that which man calls "perspective" is but an illusion. Relativity is the science of an illusion in four dimensions as perspective is in three. GOD IS LIGHT Light, as man knows light, is but an unstable simulation of the real light of the Universal One. Man's concept of light is luminosity, an illusion of the universal light of inertia, sustained in its appearance as an illusion of light by the pressures generated through motion. The inner mind of ecstatic man knows the real light and that he is One with light. He is not deceived by its illusion. Page 41 CONTENTS CHAPTER VII CONCERNING APPEARANCES During man's evolution in a universe of motion, the complexity of appearances have bewildered him into forming wrong concepts of reality and unreality. Man's life has been given so ardently to the observance of complex phenomena of appearances, that appearances have become his facts, and the one reality has become mere conjecture. Man thinks of dependability in terms of solids, those apparent things which respond to his senses. His dependable reality is form in matter. Man thinks undependability in terms of things etheric, those things which do not respond to his senses. His unreality is spirit. Man must learn to alter his concept of the reality of solidity, to the reality of Mind as the source of the illusion of that solidity. He must learn that the One substance of Mind is the only reality. He must learn to consider form as only an appearance of reality in a lower octave of the material substance of Mind, over which he has control within the limitations of Mind. He must learn to consider matter as the substance of Mind, and form in matter as but the registration of his thinking. He must learn that he is Mind and that Mind is omnipresent, omniscient and omnipotent. Until man learns that he is Mind he will be 'the slave of the illusions of Mind, instead of which he may be their master and a "creator" of these illusions. Man's universe is a universe of motion. Man's body is an aggregate of particles in motion. Man is accustomed to motion. His mind is adjusted to apparent facts of matter which cannot be actual facts, for they are all conditioned by space, time and motion. A conditioned fact cannot be a fact. It merely appears to be a fact. That a certain ball weighs a pound is a conditioned fact. Apparently the ball does weigh that much. The fact is conditioned upon keeping the ball at the same distance from the ground. Lift it one foot and it weighs less than a pound. Keep it at the same height, and still its weight varies with the movement of the stars in space. That a ball drops to the ground in a vertical line is a conditioned fact. Apparently the ball does drop straight toward the earth. In reality, the line is curved, the curve being conditioned by the rotation of the earth and its movement through space. This idea may be clarified by imagining a man suddenly created, full grown and highly educated. This man differs from other men in only one respect. He has not had a lifetime during which to adjust his mind to the relativity of things in his universe of motion, as others have had. He knows all the supposed facts of things but he has still to learn their apparent relationships; he has yet to find that things seem to be what he knows they are not. Such a man would find himself in a most bewildering world, a world of very complex effects of very simple causes. He knows that men are of about the same size, yet before him is a giant, a huge man among pygmies. Page 42 The man ten feet away must be a dwarf, and the group across the street mere toys. The sun he knows to be vast, hot and white, and the world small in comparison. Yet the sun is only a dinner plate and deliciously warm. Lo! it turns red and plunges into the sea. The world is huge and has swallowed the little sun. He knows the world is round, but here it is before him flat. A speck appears upon the horizon. It can be nothing. In an hour it is a little boat like those in the children's pond, to be carried home on the end of a string. Yet there are a thousand tons in that toy and fifty men curse up wind as they reef their sails with the brine of the wind in their eyes, and the howl of the wind in their ears. The moon rushes out from behind the hill and runs as he runs, and stops as he stops. Just a little moon it is, with toy mountains. It runs away and hides behind some chimney pots. That mountain is blue and this one green. That one is flat like a stage drop scene. This one has fields with gray stone walls, and roads with many trees. That is a very little mountain, for lo! the ox on the ridge has blotted it out. It is gone. No, here it is back again and the ox has gone. Where did the mountain go? How did it come back? And where has the ox gone? The road on the opposite hill stands on its end, but it lowers itself as he goes down the road on his hill. And the opposite hill, itself, flattens. It squats down behind the trees on his road. Or do the trees rise up and grow gigantic as he moves. The iron rails, spreading wide at his feet, meet in a point out there. A railroad train grows from a speck, to a match, to a box, and thunders past, a ponderous thing, shaking the earth in its fearsome passing. What magician has wrought this miracle? This new made man knows of the majesty of ten billion suns which blaze in the firmament of night. Their hot fire pits swirl in hundred thousand mile pools of swirling. Where is 'the glory of these fearsome orbs? Their ardent fires are twinkling candles snuffed out by breathing of soft blown winds. The milky way is but a mist blown across the darkness of night. For such a man time, only, could adjust his mind to the relativity of appearances and the conditions of facts. Ah weal! The universe of man is but a kaleidoscope turning, ever turning, and complexing with its turning. This universe of form is a universe of INTEGRATION, DISINTEGRATION AND REINTEGRATION. All form integrates through that contractive, gravitative state of motion which has the apparent power of attracting particles in motion into closer proximity to each other, disintegrates through that expansive, repulsive, radiative state which has the apparent power of separating particles in motion, and reintegrates through a union of both forces, by regenerative impact, in inertia. Page 43 CONTENTS CHAPTER VIII THE SEX PRINCIPLE Sir Oliver Lodge points out that man has long been familiar with force and motion, but that some third intangible, undiscovered force is recognizedly necessary to complete a logical universe. Force and motion infer that the third undiscovered force is existent somewhere back of, or with them. He also states that, when discovered, it may prove to be something with which man is already familiar. Sex is the great third principle. Sex is the controlling cause of both force and motion. Without it, neither could continue. To say that Mind is the motive power back of force and motion, is but stating a generality; but to state an attribute of Mind by means of which force and motion are controlled, is being specific. Sex is the motive power behind force and motion. Sex is the apparent division of the father-mother substance of Mind into apparent oppoposites. This division is due to the opposite desires of electricity and magnetism, expressed in the action' and reaction of the thinking process. Sex is the active desire of Mind for division into opposites, and its reactive desire for unity. Sex is that motive force which demands separability into two, and equally desires union of the apparent two into one. Mind, being One, cannot yield to the desire of Mind for separation into two. Sex desire of Mind for divisibility into two succeeds only in producing an appearance of divisibility into two. Likewise, sex desire of Mind for unity into One succeeds only in reproducing an apparent composite of the two. Sex is of all things from the beginning. Sex begins when light begins. Sex is the desire for the appearance of being which constitutes the appearance of existence. Nothing can be, without the desire to be. All things are which desire to be. Desire dominates all thinking. Desire dominates all matter. All desire is sex desire. All desire is for the continuance of existence in the orderliness of existence. Sex desire is that force in thinking which continues thinking. Existence is continued only through thinking. Sex force is that quality in the electromagnetic impulse of thinking which continues one impulse of thinking into the next impulse of thinking. Sex force, like all phenomena of motion, is periodic. Sex periodicity continues the simple beginning of idea into the complexity of idea. Sex force is the builder of the apparently many things out of the reality of the One thing. Periodic variance of sex is the father of desire for the creation of the idea of many things. Page 44 Remove the image making faculty of the father force of Mind, and the production of idea would discontinue. Variance of sex is the mother of desire for unity of sex. Remove the sex desire of Mind for the unity of One-ness of the mother force of Mind, and reproduction of the idea of Mind would discontinue. Matter cannot continue its appearance of existence as form, without the desire to continue such an appearance of existence. The material substance of Mind cannot evade its materialization into the form desired by Mind. This is an immutable law to which there can be no exception. Man's concept of sex as beginning with organic life is a wrong concept. Sex is as absolute in the elements as in the complexities and compounds of the elements. Man's concept of the beginning of sex and the beginning of life is a concept founded on conditions of temperature. Sex and life and light and intelligence are in and of all things from the beginning. The sex principle is as much a part of the granite rock or bar of iron as it is of man. The great hot star called Argo, blazing away at a temperature of thirty thousand degrees, knows sex in its fiery heart, and cannot continue its appearance without it. The Martian ice cap knows sex in its frozen depths, and retains its appearance because of sex. Sex is an electro-magnetic equalizer of matter in motion. Sex is the apparent division of the One force into electricity and magnetism, two opposite forces, positive and negative, which are in reality but two pulsations of the One force. Sex is the apparent division of all things into their opposites, male and female. Sex is evolutionary in all things. All things are both male and female. All creation is first male in preponderance, then it is similarly female. All light units and systems of light units are first male-female, then they are female-male. Apparent opposites of the indivisible substance of universal Mind are not content to remain in the state of apparent opposition. Unity, or Oneness, inherent in all things, asserts itself in dissatisfaction when electromagnetic forces of matter in motion are sufficiently generative to cause too great an inequality between the apparent opposites. Sex is unsatisfied when the electro-magnetic forces of matter in motion are unequal, and it is satisfied when those forces are equal. A lightning flash is the power of sex equalizing positive and negative electro-magnetic disturbances of equilibrium between two oppositely and unequally charged storm clouds. In motion-in-inertia, sex desire is negative. In motion-in-opposition, sex desire is positive. It is dynamic. Sex first asserts itself in form. All form appears through sex, passes through a progressive charige called "growth" and disappears. All growth is impelled by force and motion, and controlled by sex. Neither sex, nor force, nor motion is of itself alone. Each is of the others. Nothing is of itself alone. There can be no force without thinking. Page 45 There can be no motion without the force of thinking. There can be no idea of Mind without sex opposition. There can be no continuity of idea without sex union. Without union in mating, the idea of any one thing would be extinct as an appearance. Thinking and working are the causes of those elements which man calls sex, force and motion. Without all three of these there could be no appearance of existence as man knows existence. Thinking and working continue the appearance of all idea from the high to the low octaves of creation. All creating things are but the ideas of divine Mind. The whole idea of all things is in the seed of all things. In the seed of idea is the whole of idea. In the seed of the oak is the whole of the oak. In the seed of the rose is the whole of the rose. In the seed of man is the whole of man. The seed of all idea is in thinking. The whole idea of the oak, or the rose, or man is the result of thinking and working for perhaps a billion years of continuing the idea of the oak, the rose or man in the seed thereof. This is the law of evolving existence. It is as true of complex, as it is of simple things. All idea is registered in the little particles heretofore referred to as light units. These units of light, heat, sex, electricity and magnetism, are all male and all female. Every unit is either preponderantly male or preponderantly female. Just so is every unit either preponderantly electric or preponderantly magnetic. Just so is every unit either preponderantly negatively, or preponderantly positively, electro- magnetic. Just so is every unit preponderantly generative or preponderantly radiative. And each unit is all of these. And each unit is variable, becoming preponderantly one or another of these in its turn, from the beginning to the end of its being. And the variability is orderly, and governed by measurable laws of periodicity, which are also the laws by which motion is governed. It must not be forgotten that all that man calls creation is the result of motion which is due to the opposing impulses of thinking. It must not be forgotten that a continuance of motion causes a creating and not a created universe. The electro-magnetic action of the impulses of thinking is continuous in its opposing, and therefore are the effects of that opposition continuous. Opposing desire in sex expression is the cause of opposing motion. A cause cannot evade its effect. Opposing electro-magnetic impulses are sex-expression in creative thinking. Opposing electro-magnetic impulses reproduce all effects of creative thinking. Form is born true to the rhythm of thinking. All thinking is rhythmic thinking. Idea is synchronous with the rhythm of thinking. All thinking is sex thinking. "Creation": is the transforming of the One substance by the rhythmic thinking of idea, into apparent opposites, and into that which man calls form. Beyond this there is no more. Creation is but a concept Page 46 of Mind. It is but an illusion, an effect of thinking. All thinking is registered in light. All light is sex expression. Light is the language of all thinking. Light is the energy of all thinking. All energy is the energy of sex expression. There is no other energy. Through evolving sex, light causes the transition of the universal substance into form. Through sex periodicity, light transforms form into variety of form. This universe of motion is a universe of PRODUCTION, DESTRUCTION and REPRODUCTION. All form is produced by the male, electropositive, plus action of the charging, electric oscillation of the universal life principle, is destroyed by the female, electronegative, minus reaction of the discharging, magnetic oscillation, and is reproduced through the union of both by radio-active regeneration in inertia. Page 47 CONTENTS CHAPTER IX SEX OPPOSITES OF LIGHT Light is the power which God has used to create the appearance of form. Light is power for man to use in the perfection of his body. Therefore must he know the cause of light as he knows his alphabet. He must understand the inexhaustible source of energy which continues matter in motion, if he would know the fullness of energy available to his command. The rhythm of creative thinking is absolute. The registration of creative thinking is absolute. All thinking is creative thinking. All thinking is creating that which it is thinking. Man's power of thinking is in sex opposition of Mind. God's power of expressing Himself is in transforming that which is His own body into an effect which man calls "creation." The universal One has no other means of expressing idea save through His own body. Man's power of expressing the idea of himself is only through his own body. Man has expressed himself through the creation of his own body by his own thinking, exactly as God has expressed Himself through the creation of His own body by His own thinking. Man's body is but an individual effect of the whole of man and is the product of his thinking. The universe is the total of all individual effects, and is the product of God's thinking. God's thinking is man's thinking. All thinking is the product of Mind, and all Mind is divine Mind. Again must it be written: "there are not two Minds nor are there two kinds of Minds in the universe." Light is God's medium of expressing himself. It is the only medium at His command. Light is man's medium of expressing himself. It is the only medium at his command. Creation of that which man calls form has a perpetual beginning and a perpetual ending. Its beginning is in thinking. Its end is in thinking. Its beginning is its ending. It has no beginning. It has no ending. There is no stop, no break, in the continuity of thinking. To man, its beginning is its appearance within his octaves of perception. To man, its ending is its disappearance beyond his range of perception. Form is born of the desire to express idea. Form is the plaything of idea. All form is form of sex. Idea is never satisfied with form. Form of idea is continuously changing with the process of thinking. Form is born anew with each impulse of thinking. Idea is reasserted in new form with each impulse of thinking. All idea of Mind is integrated through generative, or male sex thinking. Page 48 All idea of Mind is disintegrated through radiative, or female sex thinking. All idea of Mind is reproduced through the regenerative union of sex •thinking, which is equilibrium of sex. Idea of Mind may mature, or evolve, only through sex union. Consider any idea of Mind, whether that of individual man or of the universal One. Man thinks idea. Thinking is the force of motion. All motion is expressed in waves. All waves of motion are both male and female. All motion is oscillatory action and reaction. Action is male. Reaction is female. All idea is registered in light as an appearance of the form of idea. Form of substance is electro-magnetic. This means that it is preponderantly male and preponderantly female in periodicity. All idea evolves from idea into form of idea, which in turn devolves back again into idea. Evolution is growth. Devolution is dissolution. Evolution is male. It is electrically preponderant. Devolution is female. It is magnetically dominant. Man can only mature idea through the orderly periodicities of sex thinking. To evolve idea he must think in light. Genero-active light is the creative force of sex thinking. Radio-active light is the decreative force of sex thinking. Union of these two opposites into the constant of one which is in equilibrium and has impacted in inertia, is the reproductive force. Sex is a dimension of the illusion of form, and as such it will be further considered with other dimensions of illusion which will be written down and charted. Page 49 CONTENTS CHAPTER X THE REPRODUCTIVE PRINCIPLE Reproduction means the repetition of a state of motion. Reproduction is repetition. All phenomena of nature are repeative. All states of motion are repeative. All idea of Mind is repeative. Idea of Mind is the product of thinking. Repetition of idea is the reproduction of that product. This is a universe of repetition of motion. This is a universe of reproduction. This universe of cause and effect is perpetual and continuous as to cause, and repeative as to all effects of cause. All effect is caused by thinking and registered in motion. All motion is either an action or reaction of its cause. Nothing is produced as an effect of thinking that is not either the action or reaction of force expressed in motion. That which is produced must be reproduced.: No state of motion ever ends. All states of motion are forever reproduced. All states of motion of apparently separate things are actions and reactions of the force which produced them. All varying idea of Mind is registered in separate states of motion which have measurable dimensions. The reproduction of all idea is the result of union of the action and reaction which register that idea. Every action is male. Every reaction is female. Every action is electro-positive. Every reaction is electro-negative. Every action has its equal and opposite reaction. Every action and every reaction is a tone in an octave of the universal constant of energy. Equal and opposite actions and reactions, when united, comprise a unit of an octave of the universal constant of energy. An action and its opposite reaction are not two. Their energies, when combined, make one. Reaction is born of action; and action is born again of reaction. All idea, and all forms of idea are the result of union between equal or unequal opposite actions and reactions of force. Perfection of mating lies in the union of exactly equal and opposite male actions and female reactions. In perfection of union lies stability. Imperfection of mating lies in the union of unequal and opposite male actions and female reactions. In imperfection of union lies instability. Unequal actions and reactions will unite with unwillingness which increases in proportion to their degree of departure from exact equality in opposition. Page 50 When the potentials of the opposites are too far removed from equality, then will union cease. In organic life the union or reproduction of opposites is limited, and beyond the limitations reproduction is impossible. In the chemistry of inorganic life the unstable union of unequal and opposite states of motion is also limited, and beyond the limitations union and reproduction is impossible. This is a universe of reproduction of idea in accumulated potential of the constant of energy, of registration of the soul of idea in inertia, and of reproduction of accumulated potential. The idea of all things is produced by union of opposite actions and reactions under conditions favorable to union, and is • reproduced only under similar conditions. Reproduction is governed by the following laws: Unions of opposed actions and reactions are possible only within certain limitations. When union does not take place there can be no reproduction. Equal and opposite actions and reactions, when united, are satisfied in their unions and will remain united. Stable unions will always reproduce true to species. Unequal and opposite actions and reactions, when united, are unsatisfied in their unions and will always seek their true tonal mates. Unsatisfied unions are unstable unions. Unstable unions never reproduce true to species. Unstable unions tend to return to their separate tonal states. If either mate in an unstable union finds a more equal mate, it will always leave the former and go to the latter.
