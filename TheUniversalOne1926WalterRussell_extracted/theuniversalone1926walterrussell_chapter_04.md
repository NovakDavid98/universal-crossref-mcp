It is the beginning of the appearance of form. It is the beginning of the combination of form into the appearance of elements of matter and of compounds of matter, into that which man calls "growth." It is the beginning of apparent transformation of the infinitely simple into the infinitely complex. It is the beginning of the inter-relationship of matter, which man calls "the chemistry of matter." It is the beginning of force and the motion of force and the inertia of motion. It is the beginning of time. Time begins with the impulses of universal thinking. It is the beginning of that universal rhythmic swing of the cosmic pendulum toward the apparent intent of unequilibrium, which is the cause of all creating things. It is the beginning of the illusion of separateness into the appearance of many things. There are no separate things. There is but the One thing. Nothing is of itself alone. It is the beginning of the souls of creating things and of the expression in matter of that which man calls "life." The whole of creation is contained in the desire of universal Mind to express idea, form and rhythm, in accord with immutable law, in endless sequence through endless ages. Beyond this there is no more. All Mind is universal and all Mind has all-power. The Mind of man is universal Mind. Man has all-power. Page 73 All-power is universally present throughout the entirety of this dimensionless universe. All matter and 'all creating things are the images of thinking Mind. Thinking Mind is light; and light is universal. That which is universal is not separable from itself. Omnipotence is therefore universal even to the last corpuscle of the most insignificant atom. All matter is omnipotent. The universe of matter is breathing its energy in tune with the One breathing, pulsing, living Being, call it what you will, whether it be God, or Mind, or the universal One. The inbreathing, outbreathing impulses of the living, thinking God-Mind is in absolute equilibrium throughout the universe. They are also simultaneous, but alternately preponderant. Exhalation proceeds in a lesser degree during inhalation and inhalation continues, but in a lesser degree, when exhalation is in preponderance. Also all motion- is simultaneous in its opposition. The opposing motions are merely alternately preponderant. All motion is oscillatory, because of this sequence of preponderance in its opposition, of which much will be written in its proper place. No atom, no man nor creating thing can all-power from the universal One, or increase or decrease it, or be independent of it in whole or in part. All-power is the thinking power of Mind. All the universe is Mind and all the universe is thinking in unison. Mind is that universal One thing which man calls "God." Mind is the universe. Mind is all. ONE. Page 74 CONTENTS CHAPTER XIX OMNISCIENCE Within the thinking substance of universal Mind is all knowledge. The entire substance of Mind is knowledge. Knowledge is universal. Man's concept of all-knowledge and all-intelligence is a wrong concept. To man, knowledge is quantitively limitless and infinitely complex. Man conceives the boundaries of knowledge and intelligence to be far beyond his comprehension. This is not a true concept. The knowledge and intelligence of universal Mind is limited and simple. Knowledge is perception of dimensionless existence, nothing more. Knowledge is an attribute of substance. It belongs to existence and the reality of existence. Knowledge might be likened unto the alphabet. Within the alphabet is all knowledge but until it is put into words and phrases the alphabet is devoid of idea. Intelligence is an understanding of the reality of existence as it is registered in the illusion of existence. Intelligence belongs to motion and not to substance. It belongs to the appearance of existence and to the unreality of the illusions of existence. Knowledge is passive, inert. It belongs to the equilibrium of unchanging causes. Intelligence might be likened unto the putting together of the alphabet of knowledge into words and phrases of infinite variety of idea. If the universal One had not a creative thinking Mind He would possess all-knowledge but would be without intelligence. Intelligence is the act of thinking creatively, or in other words, the act of putting together the illusions of idea into the forms of those illusions. Intelligence is active, opposing. It belongs to the opposed motion of changing effects. Changing effects cannot be known, they can only be comprehended. All knowledge of the illusion of existence is limited to perception of causes of that illusion. Causes are unchanging. Causes are existent. Knowledge is limited to that which is existent. Effects are non-existent. They but appear to exist. They are but idea in transit. All idea is transitory. The idea of thinking Mind is always in motion, and, therefore, constantly changing. Solids are as changing as the sunset sky. Their difference of motion is but relative. Therefore, man cannot acquire knowledge from changing effects. He can but acquire a comprehension of its complexities. Man can have no knowledge of the sunset sky, for it is but an effect. Man can have knowledge of the cause of a sunset sky, and its effect he can comprehend. Knowledge is simple as cause is simple. Comprehension may be ever so complex. That which man calls "knowledge" is based upon observed causes and effects of complex facts of matter. Page 75 There are no unconditioned facts of matter in a universe of motion. There are but appearances of facts. Man concedes that all our knowledge must ultimately repose on conditions which are unproved and unprovable. Facts of form in matter are unprovable in a world of space, time and motion. Matter as form in motion is but an ever changing effect of an unchanging substance. Effects of matter are manifested in form. Effects are fleeting. They are ever changing. Form is fleeting. It is ever changing. Effects of causes are facts only in appearance. Appearances of this moment are not the same the next moment. The facts of appearances disprove themselves in the proving. All facts of form in matter are as the sunset sky. They are but fleeting effects. Causes of the appearance of existence are the only unconditioned facts. In a universe of motion "things are not what they seem," and "there is nothing permanent but change." All form is constantly in transit between appearance and disappearance. Transition is not existence. It is but an effect of motion upon a substance which alone is existent. The ripples on the water are an effect upon the substance of water. They have no existence in themselves. Without the substance of water they could not have appeared. Having appeared as idea of ripples they will disappear into the substance of water. That which periodically appears in transit throughout the ten octave range of idea, will also periodically disappear. That which appears must disappear, but also must it reappear in accordance with the immutable law that no state of motion ever ends. The divine concept is eternally repeative in the reproduction of idea into form, and its dissolution back again into the memory of form. All idea is periodic in its repetitiveness of form and of the memory of form. The divine concept, in its entirety, is a stupendous but comprehensible effect of a very simple cause. All effects of this creating universe can be comprehended when all causes are known. The limitations of all thinking are within the laws of motion and the effects of motion. Man can conceive nothing beyond the effects of motion and its cause. No phenomena of matter can be new phenomena of matter. Nothing is or will be, which has not always been. All phenomena of matter have finite limitations. All complexities of matter are but effects of light in its orderly and limited variance of motion. The forms or images of idea are limited even in their variability and complexity to the limitations of the ten octave range of thinking. Omniscience does not mean unlimited knowledge. It means all the knowledge that there is. Complexity of idea does not constitute new knowledge. Quantity and complexity of fleeting effects of unknown causes do not add to knowledge or to intelligence. Knowledge cannot be added to or subtracted from. Page 76 Knowledge cannot transcend knowledge. Mere possession of knowledge, or storing of idea, is not indicative of intelligence. A man may be an encyclopedia of knowledge but still lack the dynamic intelligence necessary in order to use it by giving it expression as idea. The acquisition of knowledge by man may be likened unto the counting of grains of sand. A lifetime of futile counting and the beach is still uncounted, while ten times ten million beaches await his useless counting. Men's lives are spent in forever counting unnumbered grains of sand. Men's lives are spent in studying complex, incomprehensible effects of unknown causes. A study of the stars is more ponderous than the counting of grains of sand, but it is of no more import. Knowledge invites conception of idea in infinite variety, the complexities of which are apparently existent, through the act of thinking. It is as though the alphabet desired its letters arranged in infinite variety of idea. The attribute of desire in knowledge is the cause of the dynamic activity of intelligence. Complexity of idea in forms of matter is only an appearance registered in low octaves of accumulated high octaves. To man, an appearance is that which comes within the range of his perception. When an appearance "disappears" it has only gone beyond his range of perception. Appearance within the range of man's perception does not mean new existence. Disappearance beyond the range of man's perception does not mean cessation of existence. The cloud which disappears beyond the hill does not cease to be a cloud because of its dis- appearance. Vapor which disappears from man's sense of vision does not cease to be water. It can again reappear to the vision of man as water. Light which disappears into an octave higher than that at which man can perceive it does not cease to be existent as light. The thinking of Mind is within the limitations of the knowledge of Mind. The thinking of Mind is limited to the cognizance of universal being. The limitations of knowledge are within knowledge itself. Beyond the existence of Mind there is no more. Mechanics and mathematics, ideals and ideas, science and art, "solids" of matter and the effects of motion are all complex effects of perfect thinking. That which man calls spirit is not extraneous to matter. Matter and spirit are one. Spirit could not create a new substance extraneous to itself. One substance cannot become another substance. Mind is the only existent substance. Nothing is existent that is not spiritual. As existence is limited to thinking, and thinking is limited to ten octaves, man's concept of an infinite spiritual existence is a mistaken one. Mind, being all that exists, is limited to its own ten octave range of thinking and is also confined to the act of thinking. It has no other purpose nor any other possible activity. That which is limited cannot be infinite, but it can be eternal. Spiritual existence is finite. It is a limited but eternal existence. Page 77 If divine Mind were an infinite Mind it could not be comprehensible to man, but its simple limitations make it easily comprehensible. If thinking is the cause of all effect and thinking is limited in range, then are the effects of that cause limited in range. Heat is an effect of thinking which has its limitations. Motion, volume, weight, mass, sex, sound, color, form; all these are effects which have their limitations. These effects are comprehensible. Comprehension is therefore limited to the range of possible effect. All-intelligence does not therefore mean unlimited comprehension. It means all the intelligence that there is. Finite limitations in the expression of Mind in idea might be likened unto the limitation of the painter to the colors on his palette. The painter has infinite variation, within the color range of his palette, in the expression of the idea of the image making faculty of his mind. Within these limitations his complexities of variation are without end but beyond them he cannot go. He is limited by his color range. The color spectrum is his palette and it has its limitations. The Master-Painter is thus limited by the range of His spectrum but within these definite limitations He has infinite possibilities for expression of the ideas of the image making faculty of His thinking Mind. Limitations which are definite cannot be infinite. Divine existence is contained within the limitations of the range of Divine thinking. Beyond this range divine Mind cannot perceive or think. The illusions or appearances, which man mistakes as existence, are but reappearances of old illusions. Reappearance is repeativeness. The orderliness of created things is due to the invariability of cyclic periodicity in all effects of thinking. The pitch and tone and measure and meter of true thinking is due to the absolute rhythm of the repeating periodicities of thinking. The very dependability of universal Mind, reflected in nature's inexorable laws, is due to universal limitations. God has set his own immutable laws in orderly, repeating periodicities of thinking. He Himself is limited by them. He Himself is bound to the observance of them. God cannot, never has, and never shall change His own immutable laws. Upon this fact is based the very dependability of the universe. Man's belief that God sets aside his own laws to perform miracles is a primitive concept of superstitious man Superstition belongs to primitive man who is but learning how to think from within, When primitive man first catches gleams of the divinity within him he is then rising above the thinking of the animal which he has been. Upon these faint gleams he builds his primitive concepts based on fear of that which is superior to himself. Page 78 To primitive man modern man owes his concepts of a cruel God of supernatural power. These wrong concepts have become traditions of man's mind and habits of his thinking. Modern man inherits the habits of the unbalanced thinking of primitive man. Orderly thinking is perfect equilibrium. Against perfect equilibrium nothing imperfect can prevail. Variation of the measure of true thinking would throw the rhythm of orderly thinking out of tune and the universe could not be. To think in light is to think only perfection, for perfection is all that is written there. Mind is perfect. There is no evil. Imperfection, or evil, is non-existent. Man's concept of evil is a wrong concept. Evil is as impossible as unequilibrium is impossible. The reader will remember that all thinking is an oscillation between two equal and opposite actions and reactions. He will remember that the union of any two exactly equal and opposite actions and reactions make one. Man has control over his actions, but he has no control over the reactions to those actions. The appearance of evil is merely potential out of place, and suspended there for the time. Like the apple on the tree gravitation will eventually restore it to its proper place in equalized potential. From this inevitable return to the stability of conquering truth there is no escape. The apple, as accumulated potential suspended out of place, will seek its own potential by falling toward higher pressures when the stem weakens by disintegration. Again, the decaying apple, disintegrating into gases of lower potential, will seek the place of lower potential by rising into lower pressures. Just so with evil. It is but an action which must eventually meet its reaction. That action which man calls wrong thinking is simultaneously written on the soul as positive charge and is balanced by its opposite and equal negative reaction. Thus the equilibrium of the universe remains constant and man has recorded his own thinking, which he may correct at will, on his soul; but correct it he must. CONCERNING THE SOUL Man is ever concerned regarding his "soul" and its habitation "after death." Man need have no concern. Man's soul is but the memory of the evolving idea of man. Out of the soul the body is again born. The soul is but the record of man's thinking. The evolving idea of man cannot forever be held in suspense in inertia. The soul of a "dead" man is but the record of a man asleep for a while, awaiting the renewal of his body. The first part of sleep is but a centrifugal, decentrative reaction to a centripetal concentrative period of action. Page 79 It is the expanding, dissipative, non-creative impulse of thinking, just as wakefulness is the contracting, generative, creative impulse. It is the period of preponderantly exothermal, electronegative discharge when the body degenerates in preponderance to its generation. Later during sleep, the centripetal concentrative action begins to accumulate until it becomes sufficiently preponderant to cause the state of what is known as wakefulness. In the same way during the first part of the day the contracting generative impulse is in preponderance, but later "fatigue" shows that the expanding, non-creative impulse of thinking is increasing until it in turn becomes predominant and causes another period of sleep. And so the pendulum swings. As in all other phenomena of motion, sleep and wakefulness are simultaneous in the expression of their opposition, but preponderantly one or the other in sequence. Just so with life and death. From the moment of birth we begin to die. Generation of that which man knows as life merely predominates until that which he knows as death takes its turn in orderly sequence. Death is just a longer sleep than the daily sleep. The difference is in the duration of the sleep. CONCERNING REINCARNATION Death is a life period of sleep for total bodily regeneration, just as the daily sleep is for partial bodily regeneration. Regeneration of the soul is reincarnation of the body. The chemistry of the soul of all idea is registered in the master tones, known as the inert gases. The soul is the matrix of the body just as the master tones are the matrices of the elements. The inert master tones of an octave of the elements contains a complete and exact record of every effect of motion within its octave. The soul of man contains a complete and exact record of every action and reaction of thinking man. "The moving finger writes; and having writ, Moves on: nor all thy Piety nor Wit shall lure it back to cancel half a line, Nor all thy tears wash out a word of it." Creation is just a swing of the cosmic pendulum between sleep and sleep, between awakening and awakening, and one follows the other as the night follows the day and the day again follows the night. While sleeping for a night man does not cease to be. Nor does he fear to sleep, for he knows that sleep is beautiful, and he will awaken at the dawn of a new day. Man fears to die for he knows not what the dark sleep of death will bring. He knows not that death is but a longer and more beautiful sleep from which he will awaken with a newly regenerated body, to begin once more, his periodicity of growth at the dawn of another new day of life. Man fears the hobgoblins of primitive man's concept of punishment of the soul for the "sins' of the body. He fears the dark sleep of death with its terrors much as a child which has been frightened by ghost stories fears the dark with its same imaginary terrors. With new comprehension man can eliminate the imaginary hobgoblins and fears from his declining years and go to the sleep of his disappearance as form, in peace. In disappearance man does not cease to be. In his disappearing, the idea of man does not discontinue. Page 80 As the day disappears only to reappear in its proper periodic interval, so must man reappear. All appearances and disappearances are periodic. Also are all reappearances periodic. Appearances and disappearances are but moving points in the cycle of Mind. In this universe of motion creating things do not pause at any point. There are no created things. There are but creating things ever integrating, ever moving, ever evolving in the integration and the assembling of the idea of themselves. No form of life has been created. It is creating. Nothing has been. All things are being. Evolving idea into form is a positive action requiring the creative intelligence of imagination. A man who only has great knowledge has a negative possession. Poor he is indeed. A man who has great imagination has a positive, dynamic possession. Rich he is for knowledge is within him and of a certainty he shall find it. Knowledge of existence is not acquired from without, it is recollected from within. When man learns new things he is but recollecting old experiences of his thinking, thought by him before in higher octaves. Man is not deceived about the illusive non-permanent quality of the evolving ideas of his own thinking. He knows that they will soon pass and that he cannot hold their evolving forms in suspension, unchanging, for one instant. The relative scale of man's objective universe deceives him as to the illusion of his evolving idea. The universal Mind thinks idea into form exactly as man thinks idea into form. The universal One cannot hold the evolving form of divine idea in suspension any more than man can. There is but one process of thinking for there is but One Mind. There are not two Minds nor two methods of thinking: _nor are there two sets of laws governing thinking. Nor are there two separate substances, nor two separate things nor two separate beings in the universe. All thinking is universal thinking. All thinking things are thinking in unison. All are creating that which they are thinking. All thinking things are self creating. All thinking things are creating all things. Man is his own creator. Man is the creator of all that is. This shall man know when he shall think within in the higher octaves of light of his inner Mind. When man shall know the language of the universal One of Whom he is a part, then shall he know the Voice of the universal One. The still small Voice within universal man speaks to him in the language of light, in words of tones in the speed of light. Within the heart of thinking man the silent Voice has forever asked: "WHO AM I?" Since the beginning man cried aloud, "WHO AM I?" And the Voice answered, "Thou Art I. I, the universal One, am thou whom thou art creating in my image." Page 81 The Voice within man, insatiable, asks forever: "WHO AM IT" And the still small Voice answers: "I am I. I am I whom I am creating. I am the universal I." "I am all that is, and Thee. "I am He that is One with me. "I am the empire of I that am I." Since the beginning the Voice within man asks: "WHENCE CAME I?" And the Voice forever answers: "I am of the universal passion of creation. "I came from God. "I am of God. "I am soul, record of idea. "Where God is I am. "Where I am there God is." Within man the Voice of long ages demands: "WHAT AM IT" And the familiar Voice answers: "I am of the body of God, born of his substance. "God is Mind I am Mind. "God is Truth. I am Truth. "God is Love. I am Love. "God is Life. I am Life. "God is Light. I am Light. "God is Power. I am Power. "What God is, I am. What He commands, I command. "My purpose is His purpose." "God lives in me. My inheritance is from God and of God." "He gives all to me. He withholds nothing." "The Divinity of me is thine and mine. It is that which is recorded within the soul of me. It is the Holy Spirit within the sanctuary of me." "I am an idea, of thine. The body of me is the idea of the soul of me. It is mine and thine." "I am the master sculptor. My body is the plastic clay. My soul is the mother-mould of my body, the matrix for my regeneration." "I am what I am. "I shall be what I desire to be. "What I am I have desired to be. "I am the sum of my own desire. Page 82 "I am thou, creator of myself. "Thou art I, creator of all." "I am thou, creator of all; for thou hast made it known in my heart that I am not of myself alone." "I am thou and thou art I." "I am of the farthermost star and of the blade of grass in my door yard. I am of my brother and of the mountain." "The ecstasy of my thinking varies the spectra of ten times ten billion stars and illumines the ether of endless space." "Thy thinking has created all that is. "My thinking is thy thinking. "My thinking has created all that is. "I am ecstatic man. "I am man, self creating. "I am God, creator of man. "I am father of myself. "I am son of the living God." "The ends of space are mine. I shall know no limitations that are not thy limitations." Within man the still small Voice asks from the beginning and ceaselessly: "WHY AM I?" And the Voice answers: "I am an expression of the universal passion of creation." "God created me that I should fulfill his purpose. God gave me desire to create and the power of creation." "God dwells within me. I shall not deny the power within me which is God within me." "I shall not close the ears of my soul to the whisperings of my soul, which makes me dwell on the mountain top in ecstasy of inner thinking." "The universal desire is expression of idea through the rhythm of thinking, in accord with the law, in endless sequence throughout endless space." Within man the ever questioning universal Voice beseeches: "WHITHER AM I BOUND?" And the Voice answers: "God was my beginning, is my substance and shall be my end." "Froth the One I came. To the One I return." "I but tarry by the way to do the will of the One." "I am universal man, the image of my Creator. Ecstasy and exaltation attend me, for I know that all that is, is within me." "My dwelling place is in the high heavens on the mountain top, above the waters and the earth." "I range the high heavens in ecstasy. "My feet are wings. "The ends of space are mine." "I sing praises unto all the universe by the way. The hosts of heaven rejoice with me by the way." "I have denied my unity. My universality I have not known." "My dwelling place was the earth. I walked the earth heavily in chains " "My earth-bound feet dragged heavily after me. I wearied of the long road." Page 83 "My back bent with the ache of its burden. "I was lonely and the way dark." "I shall not deny my One-ness and live in the loneliness of the dark." "I shall know my universality and I shall dwell on the mountain top in the light of inner thinking." "Hope dwells in the light. "Despair lurks in the dark. "Life and growth are of the light. "Death and destruction are of the dark." MEMORY The acquisition of new knowledge by man is but the re-thinking or recollection of old knowledge. Learning is not acquisition; it is recognition of a truth through the act of recollection. Recollection is the act of transforming the potential energy of an idea stored in memory, in inertia, into the kinetic energy of active Mind which is the state of concentrative thinking. Recollection is a dynamic, concentrative action of Mind. It is therefore electro-positive, and belongs to motion-in-opposition. It is the action of again giving form to the memory of idea. Recollection differs from creation in this wise; the act of creating idea into form by concentrative thinking is an initial action. The act of recollection is a regeneration or reproduction of that initial action, the reaction of which has been stored in memory. It is the resurrection of the soul of idea into the body of it. It is the re-creation of idea into form for its further evolution. Memory is the storehouse of the idea of Mind. Thinking Mind taps that storehouse of memory in that activity of Mind which man calls by many names, such as "memory," "instinct," "intuition" and "imagination." They are all one and the same. Their varying shades of meaning indicate only the differing manner in which old recollections of memory, recorded in millions of years of evolving ideas, manifest themselves. If man could but see that the thinking of all Mind is the same, whether it be Mind of God or Mind of man, or bird, or beaver, or oak, or rose, he would have a truer concept of the universe. If he could see that there is but One Mind and that Mind is thinking in the expression of but One Idea, then he would begin to comprehend the divine conception. If he could but see that the One Idea is the whole creating, evolving universe, the one great illusion of divine Mind as a passing fancy is an illusion of man's Mind, he would be getting closer to the fundamental truth. Then if he could but see that the illusion of the One Idea is but illusion in form, the substance of which is Mind, he would not then look to illusions as dependable realities and to the One Reality as an undependable illusion. If he could go farther in his comprehension and realize that God and man and the oak and the atom are just One, and that all these are thinking .out the divine Idea, then would he be close to the door of the Holy of Holies. Perhaps it might assist thinking man toward the attainment of this concept by comparing the thinking human brain as an appearance to the thinking Mind of the universe as an appearance. Page 84 To man, the appearance of the universe is that of countless objects at limited distances one from the other. He regards himself as one of those objects, an individual, alone, independent, free of any bindings, free to think and act and do as he desires. His very breathing he regards as his own breathing, and his actions are, to his thinking, his alone. Let us look within the thinking brain, and in doing so imagine one thinking individual male unit upon one planet of one atom of the brain seeing his universe as man sees his. The appearance of the universe to this unit would be exactly the same to him as is man's universe to man. The objects within his vision would be separated by relative distances. Vast spaces would intervene between him and the vast suns in his starry heavens. Their luminosity would, to him, be relatively the same, for the positive nucleus of every system is a light giving sun. And also would their relative motion be the same, for a trillion revolutions per second of a light-unit would be just as relatively slow to him as a day is to man. Periodicity of evolution is as relative as the appearances it records. Is it not, then, just as reasonable for this diminutive thinking unit of man to think himself one in a vast universe as for man to do so? Would it not be just as difficult for him to realize that he is just one apparent unit of the whole as it is for man to do so? And as it is with this diminutive unit in hi universe within man's brain, so it is with mar in his objective universe. One is thinking man's thinking, functioning ;- in the evolution of the idea of man; and he cannot do otherwise if he will. The other is thinking the universal idea functioning in the evolution of the divine conception; and he cannot do otherwise if he will. Every in-breathing and out-breathing of either is the in-breathing and out-breathing of the living ) universal One. Every thought and every action are in accord with the universal pulsations of action and reaction of the process of thinking and they cannot be otherwise. INSTINCT Consider the manifestation known as "instinct." The beaver builds his dam, a marvelous feat of engineering. Was he taught to do it? Would he not do it just the same, and just as perfectly, if his parents and all associates were killed and he matured alone? How does he do it? "Instinct," one answers. The bee builds his marvellous cells, the spider his web; the barn swallow builds in barns and the chimney swallow in chimneys; the robin flies south and north according to the season. "Instinct" makes them do it. They cannot do otherwise, says science. Just so, they cannot do otherwise. Nor can any of us, or any creating thing do otherwise than that which it thinks and has thought for countless periods of reappearance. Page 85 These acts are all acts of thinking Mind recollecting dynamically the idea of its evolution which has been recorded as memory in motion-in-inertia during ages of building beaver dams, and honey combs, and spider webs; and during ages of migration and nest building and other characteristics of the evolving manifestation of the divine concept as a whole. IMAGINATION Consider that manifestation of recollection known as "imagination." The quality of imagination varies in accordance with the -ability to recollect memory recorded in the soul, and with the ability to think in light. To think in light is to think in higher octaves of the inner subjective Mind. To think in light is to disassociate the outer, objective mind from the inner, to blot it out as though that octave of integration had not yet been. The outer mind is concerned primarily with continuance of the body as an appearance of existence and is not at all concerned or interested in much of anything else. The outer mind of man, or of the lion, the dog or elephant, is absolutely the same. Man differs from the animal only in his ability to think in higher octaves and bring back to his outer mind recollection the perception of existence stored in motion-in-inertia in the memory of his universality. This perception of all-knowledge suspended within motion-in-inertia inspires within man that which he thinks is new knowledge and as he adds it to his thinking he again writes it upon his soul. Man does not realize that what he considers new idea brought into the appearance of existence, is but old idea stored within him projected upon the outer plane of his thinking. INSPIRATION When man gives to other men the inspiration which has come to him, he is a divine messenger of the living God delivering to man his revelation from the Holy of Holies. The genius, the super-thinker with imagination, who brings beauty to the world, is inspired man thinking in light. The greater the imagination the greater the perception of the reality of universal existence, hence the greater the intelligence. The lesser the imagination the greater the reality of the appearance of existence. The greater the imagination the nearer to One-ness and the farther from the animal. The inspired genius of great imagination has great intelligence. He is able to use his knowledge creatively. Those things which he desires to know he may know. The humble poet, inspired by knowledge conveyed to him by contemplation of the orbs of night, may give to man a message of truth which will outlive long generations of the learned whose disproved facts have died in the proving. The "prophets" were super thinking men of great genius. The "prophets" bad knowledge of the causes of things, and could foretell their effects. Comprehension of the effect of a cause is not prophecy. Out of knowledge of the beginnings of things is born the imaginings concerning future things. The weather forecast for tomorrow is not prophecy; it is an act of intelligence born of knowledge. Page 86 Genius is the forerunner of civilization. Genius knows the ecstasy of the high heavens and the mountain top. Genius is the bridge between man and God. He who will may cross it. Genius is locked within the soul of every man. He who wills may unlock its doors and know its ecstasy. Genius gives to man that which alone endures, which man has named "Art." No work of man can endure which is not born of inspiration and created in ecstasy. Genius gives to man idea, rhythm and form, which are of the soul and beyond which, in the created universe, there is nothing. Genius knows no limitations within those which are universal. Genius knows love and truth in all their fullness. Genius translates the word of the universal One into the word of man for the soul of man. They who, attain the ecstasy of genius, are ordained messengers of the universal One. Genius lifts man from the lowly stage of ferment. Man still is new. He is still but in the ferment. Genius lifts brute man to gentle man. Genius gives to man the harmonies of universal rhythm without which all is discord. Genius gives to man knowledge which is of the soul. He who tunes his heart to the messages of genius purifies himself. No impurity can there be in his heart for verily he then is in communion with the Holy One. The pure in heart know their universality. Man may know his One-ness. He who listens to the translations of genius knows the word of creation. He knows the rhythm of the universal language of light speaking in his inner Mind. Genius awaits him who listens. The messages of genius are for the inner Mind alone. The outer mind comprehends them not. To him whose inner Mind is quickened into ecstasy God speaks from the trees of the forest and he understands. To him the silent Voice of nature speaks, with understanding, from the babbling brook and the pounding sea. He knows all things. To him universal Mind unfolds truth from the light of the sun and the blue dome of the heavens. He has all knowledge. To him the rosy dawn and the golden autumn sing messages which are to him as an anointing froin the Holy One. He knows no limitations. He who has not ears to hear crucifies genius. The penalty of genius is crucifixion. The reward of genius is immortality. Whom man crucifies does he glorify with immortality. "Seven cities warr'd for Homer being dead Who living had no roofe to shroud his head." Genius desires no reward. The glory of genius is humility. Genius knows not the taint of arrogance. CONCLUSION Man has all knowledge within himself. Inspiration will unlock the doors of all knowledge. All-knowledge exists in its entirety in all the universe. All-knowledge, being universal, exists in man. Page 87 The universe is omniscient. The universe is indissolubly united. Omniscience is of the ,electron, the atom, the magnetic field of the atom, the molecule, the mountain, the man, the planet, the air, the water, the fire, the stars in the heavens and the far reaches of space. The Oneness of the universe allows no exceptions, no mistakes, no error in its all inclusiveness. Nothing is omitted from the . entirety of universal Mind. There is all-knowledge in all matter. There is all-intelligence in all matter. All matter is spirit. Spirit is God. God is universal. God is all. ONE. Page 88 Page 89 Page 90 CONTENTS BOOK II CHAPTER I DYNAMICS OF MIND CONCERNING LIGHT UNITS OF MATTER It should now be perfectly clear that this universe of Mind of which light, or matter is the substance and of which the electromagnetic energy of thinking is the force, is a dimensionless reality. It should also be perfectly clear that this creating physical universe of form is an illusion of the image-making faculty of Mind, the one inspired, supreme purpose of which is to conceive idea and give it the appearance of form. It should also be clearly understood that form and dimension are attributes of motion and in no way are they attributes of matter which is of the substance of Mind, exactly as the form of bubbles in the ocean foam are attributes of motion and not of the ocean substance. It should be perfectly understood from now on that, in making an analysis of the effects of motion which constitute this creating universe, we are dealing with an illusion, an idea only, which has its cause in thinking Mind. The universe of illusion is a corpuscular universe. All dimension of matter and energy is corpuscular. All expression of force is corpuscular. Corpuscles are inconceivably small particles of matter, or light, or Mind substance, which have been churned into motion by the electromagnetic forces of the thinking process of Mind, exactly as bubbles are particles of water and air churned into motion by the force of a propeller. The complexity of motion of these corpuscles is the sole cause of the illusion of a universe of many things evolved from the imagination of thinking Mind. As it should also by now be thoroughly understood that the words "matter" and "light" are used in the sense of characterizing the substance of Mind, and that the word "energy" is used in the sense of characterizing the force, or life principle which makes of Mind a thinking substance; that the words "electricity" and "magnetism" are used in the sense of characterizing the apparent division of the One force of energy into the appearance of two, the relator will henceforth use these words with the assur- ance that the line between reality and illusion has been sufficiently well drawn to justify the omission of qualifying words. Let it then be clearly understood that the universe of Mind is that which man characterizes as "the spiritual universe" and that the universe of dimension is man's "physical universe. One is cause. The other is effect. One is real. The other is illusion. Man has to do with illusion during those periods in which he is forming the idea of himself as illusion; so, therefore, it is necessary that he shall understand the dimensions of the universe of illusion in order that he may control them. Man has long ago discarded the corpuscular theory of light in favor of a theory of electromagnetic effect of undulating waves which are supposed to exist in the ether. Page 91 He must now replace this second theory, for the ether of man's concept is non-existent. There are no undulating ether waves. Light is corpuscular. Modern science has proved mathematically that light could not be corpuscular because of certain phenomena known as "interference" and "aberration." Modern science has reasoned that, because of the phenomenon of interference, light could not be corpuscular, for if light consisted of little particles, the phenomenon of interference would prevent light from travelling. It is presumed by man that light travels, because the evidence of his senses so convinces him. Light does not travel and the appearance of its doing so is another of the many illusions of dimension which deceive man. All light units of matter are given the appearance of form by the magnetic reaction of the attempt of electricity to seek higher pressures. This attempt is resisted by magnetism, and the resistance is registered in electricity as heat. The rebound into lower pressures and the sudden cooling of the electric whirling particle by the expansion of the lower pressure causes it to solidify. It is turned into ice.
