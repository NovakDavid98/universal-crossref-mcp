Forests may be laid low and towns wiped out by the collapse of a mighty reservoir, while far up on the mountain side children play without concern in the stream which filled that reservoir. And so it is with the universal constant of energy supplied by thinking Mind. Thinking is the only source of energy; yet the mighty power which is accumulated by thinking the idea of this universe, and registering that idea in repeative systems varying in size from those so small that a trillion could circulate in a needle point to those so large that man cannot conceive the expanse of one of them, comes from that One source and that only. Following is a list of the potential locking points of the entire ten octave cycle, and the names of the apparently different elements, or substances formed by the variation in the dimensions of those locking points. Page 127 Page 128 TABLE OF THE TEN OCTAVES OF THE VARYING STATES OF MOTION WHICH CREATE THE ILLUSION OF DIFFERENT SUBSTANCES KNOWN AS "THE ELEMENTS OF MATTER." Page 129 Page 130 Page 131 Page 132 Page 133 Page 134 Page 135 Page 136 101 - 102 - and "103 — are tonal mates of 1001+ 1002 + and 1003 +, also they are tonal mates of 101+ 102 + and 103 +. Of these elements two in the fourth octave, when discovered, will be of great use to man. Each of them will mark an epoch in human progress. Hydron (400=) the master-tone of its octave, is a non-inflammable inert gas which is in every way superior for transportation to hydrogen because it is much lighter, absolutely non-injurious and easier to produce. It has all of the safety qualities of helium and its carrying capacity exceeds that of helium by eight times and is double that of hydrogen. Both hydron and helium can be produced by transmutation in unlimited quantities at an expense which is negligible while helium, of a sufficient quantity to fill a dirigible, produced by the present methods now costs three-quarters of a million dollars. The control of the production of this gas by any nation would insure the peace of the world. Luminon (403 — ), is the basis of the cold light of the future. Luminosity of better color can be produced by regenerative excitation of this radiative gas at about one forty-thousandth of the expenditure of energy necessary to produce the same degree of luminosity by the use of a tungsten filament. Luminon can also be produced by transmutation at a negligible expenditure. Page 137 Luminon is plentiful in many, substances but its separation would involve more labor and expense than would its production by transmutation, which means simply the changing of dimension of a basic supply which is plentiful in those high octaves familiarly termed "the air." Page 138 CONTENTS CHAPTER VII INSTABILITY, AND THE ILLUSION OF STABILITY IN MOTION. The chemist can solve his problems only through knowledge of the various dimensions of the elements with which he has to deal, their relative instability, and their relative illusion of stability. To write in sufficient detail the various relations of motion, and to organize them as a higher electro- chemistry, will require a volume in itself which will follow this one at a later date. Suffice it for this volume, that the accompanying working chart of the chemist's six octaves be herein given, together with four charts demonstrating the orderliness of stability and instability in motion. The universe of motion is a swinging of the cosmic pendulum from the stability of concept in inertia to the instability of the image of concept in motion, and back again to the stability of memory of concept in inertia. Concept precedes motion. Motion begins in concept. Concept takes place in inertial equilibrium. Motion is born of opposition to equilibrium. The universal balance cannot be upset. No state other than an equilibrium is possible. The concept of an action designed to upset the universal balance by overcoming inertia is, when executed as an action, simultaneously opposed by a reaction designed to restore that balance. The result of action and reaction is to create the illusion of stability through a division of the force of action and reaction into apparent opposites. An opposed state is an unstable state which simulates stability through motion in equal and opposite actions and reactions. Therefore, stability cannot lie in motion, for all motion is opposed and divided in its opposition. Stability is the inactivity of the state of equilibrium. The dimensionless universe of concept is the universe of stability. The universe of expression of concept, through motion, is the universe of dimension. The universe of dimension is the universe of the illusion of stability. The elements of matter with which the chemist has to deal are opposed states of motion which become increasingly unstable as they depart from the inert gases, reaching maximum instability at the carbon line. The illusion of stability is least in the lower tones and reaches its maximum at the carbon line. The lower the potential, electric pressure, valency, temperature and density, the greater the stability of the elements, and the less the illusion of stability. Conversely, the higher the potential, magnetic pressure, valency, temperature and density, the less the stability and the greater the illusion of stability. Every chemical effect is an electro-magnetic effect. Every electro-magnetic effect is a mechanical effect. This universe of motion is a machine in which every mass in motion is a wheel geared into another wheel. Celestial mechanics vary not . one bit from the mechanics of man. If one wheel changes its dimensions, all wheels change to conform to that change. Page 139 The precessional movements of planets and solar systems are made with wheels of bevel gears with cones rolling upon cones and shafts eccentrically placed. The great wheels of solar systems change their bevels and their eccentricities to conform to their positions in the machine of which they are a part. There is but one position in the universal machine in which the wheels run parallel in plane without intersection, without precession and without eccentricity. In this position in the atom, or its repetition in larger masses, there are no equinoxes, no ascending or descending nodes and no aphelions or perihelions. This is in the element carbon, where inhalation ends and exhalation begins, where instability and the illusion of stability are at their maximum. There are cone and disc clutches in the universal machine which grasp and slip with the same relative persistance and looseness with which man is perfectly familiar in his mechanics. These qualities give us relatively rigid bodies, such as this dense planet, the more dense sun, pithy Saturn and vaporous Neptune. These qualities give us the same relative rigidities in the eleinents, such as carbon in the diamond, and less dense substances down through the solid metals and metaloids to their gaseous expansions in such elements as hydrogen and its mate helionon. The contours of the cone clutches which give great surface tension pressure contract toward the poles, disappearing in the axes and gravitative centers of all masses. The disc clutches which slip are the contours of expanding cones. These lose their ability to hold as the cones expand into disappearance at the equatorial planes of all masses. Stability in motion is, therefore, greatest at the centers of all masses and, superficially, at their poles. On the contrary, instability in motion is greatest at the equators of all masses. As a consequence, rigidity in all mass is greatest at its poles where the cone clutches hold, and flexibility is greatest at its equators where the disc clutches slip. The cone clutches at the poles of the sun of our solar system, for example, hold fast. That is why the expanded magnetic bases of the equatorial belt of the sun moves faster than the contracted polar magnetic bases. That is also why the equatorial belt of the sun is hotter than the polar zones. The slipping of the oppositely moving discs generates much heat. That explains the boiling bubbles which we call "sun spots" which move nearer to the equator of the sun and farther away again in oppositely whirling spiral pools during each eleven year breathing period of the sun. That is why the corona of the sun extends so far into interstellar space at its equator and so much less so at its poles. That is how, and one reason why, another planet will soon be born to the already pregnant sun. That is why Jupiter has its belts and Saturn the rings which Jupiter will also have when his axis tilts a little farther to change the bevel gearing of his wheels. That is why Uranus and Neptune are reversing their poles. That is why nature added the gyroscopic principle to her mechanics of motion in order to create the illusion of stability in her corpuscular solids of motion. That explains the isoclinal lines which run around this planet, forming new bases for the expanding cones of radiation, like the rim of an umbrella which gradually opens until it is in one plane. Page 140 Page 141 That is why all masses emanate magnetic lines of force at isoclinal lines and regenerate them by absorption at the poles. . That is why the compass needle loses its dip on the zero isoclinal line which roughly follows the geographic equator, and swings its north pole to the south magnetic pole south of that line and to the north magnetic pole when proceeding north from it. Motion is an appearance born of the axis of a conceptive cone in inertia. It assumes the appearance of an expanding cone and disappears through radiation in equatorial opposition. The universal machine is a gyroscopic top. When it is in little motion, its form is a cone, like a top gyrating unsteadily on an eccentric axis. When it is in great motion, it loses the altitude and eccentricity of its axis and becomes a gyroscope revolving steadily in one plane. The generative attractive principle is the principle of contracting cones. All mass is generated and regenerated by a contractive pressure exerted in the direction of its gravitative center. Its minimum of generative pressure is exerted from its equatorial plane and its maximum pressure from its pole. The radiative repellent principle is the principle of expanding cones. All mass is radiated and diffused by an expansive pressure exerted in the direction of its surface. Its minimum of radiative pressure is exerted from its pole and its maximum from its equatorial plane. By arranging the elements in the orderly positions of their relative stability and instability, as in the accompanying chart, the chemist can work out his problems much more simply upon paper than by experimenting in the laboratory without the knowledge of this orderliness. ___________ Page 142 Page 143 CONTENTS CHAPTER VIII THE UNIVERSAL PULSE ALL MOTION IS OSCILLATORY The One Living Being, of which all nature is a part, breathes the breath of life. Every form in nature is but a unit of the whole and sustains its appearance of existence through the life sustaining breathing of the whole. All mass is life. All mass breathes, assimilates and eliminates the life-giving property of that breathing. The breathing of the universal One is electromagnetic. All life varies in potential, and therefore all life varies relatively in the electro-magnetic voltage- amperage of its inhalation-exhalation pressures. The breathings of the ant are not of the same dimensions as the breathings of the elephant. They vary vastly, one from the other, in time, in pressures, in potential, in temperature and all other dimensions. The breathing of the sodium atom varies vastly from that of the carbon atom. They differ from each other in their accumulation of potential as do the ant and the elephant. So also does the breathing of Neptune vary from that of Jupiter or Venus or the sun in all of its periodicities. The universal phenomena of inhalation-exhalation is a fundamental life principle. The inhalative action is the cause of electricity. It is the generative principle of life, the accumulative principle, the principle of growth, the endothermic principle. It is the gravitative principle of attraction. It is the principle of evolution. It is the male principle, the positive principle, the creative principle, the assembling principle of the appearance of form. It is the winding of the cosmic clock. It is that which is known as positive electricity, which means that it is preponderantly and dominantly electric. The exhalative reaction is the cause of magnetism. It is the radiative principle of life which man erringly names "death." It is the dissipative, dissolutive, repellative principle; the decreative, the disassembling principle of disappearance of form. It is the principle of devolution. It is the female principle, the negative principle. It is the running down of the cosmic clock. It is that which is known as negative electricity, which means that electricity is magnetically dominated. Page 144 Page 145 It means less electricity and more magnetism, as positive electricity means more electricity and less magnetism. This is a universe of more and less in all of its phenomena of motion. The electricity of accumulative inbreathing is the "more" and the magnetism of separative outbreathing is the "less." The gathering together of the "more" of solidity is the attractive principle of which positive charge is the cause. The dissipation into the "less" of tenuity is the repellent principle of which negative discharge is the cause. The illusions of motion are many and are hard to detect, and the illusions of attraction and repulsion . are especially hard to detect. The universe of motion is an electromagnetic one. The accumulating potential which we know as solids of matter are preponderantly electric. The matter of man's concept is electricity. The void of man's concept is magnetism. Solidity is electro-positive. Tenuity is electro-negative. The alternating inbreathing and outbreathing of the universal constant causes an alternating change in all mass. The universal pendulum swings toward solidity with each inhalation and toward tenuity with each exhalation. These alternate swings of the universal pendulum are referred to in the scientific world by the word "oscillations." All phenomena of motion is oscillatory. All motion is forward toward the "more" and backward toward the "less." Forward toward the "more" is always toward solidity and greater pressure. Backward toward the "less" is always toward tenuity and released pressure. The forward spiral swing of the cosmic pendulum is the positive bound of energy, and the backward spiral swing is its negative rebound. The forward swing toward the "plus" is always in the direction of north by the way of east and the backward swing is always south by the way of west. All energy is renewed from the south by the way of east and dissipated toward the south by the way of west. To these periodic oscillations, alternating in sequence, is due the revolution and rotation of all mass. All evolving and devolving mass beats time in accord with its periodic sequences of alternating electro-magnetic oscillations. All mass beats time in accord with its varying potential. The electro-magnetic oscillations of the universe are the heart-beats, the life pulsations of the universal One. The universal One is the universe. Page 146 Page 147 In every evolving form Mind, the One creative force, is expressing itself. Every existent thing is creating by the continuous thinking of Mind. Nothing is which has not always been. The breathing of the One creative force is your breathing, and my breathing, and that of the meadow violet. The universal pulse is your pulse, and my pulse, and that of the giant Betelguese. The electromagnetic pulse-beats of a light unit may be thirty trillion to a second and those of an accumulation of light units in the mass of our sun may be months apart, just as its inhalation-exhalation period is approximately eleven years. Betelguese may have a breathing period of a thousand years, but time is a purely relative dimension and all periods vary only in dimension. The pulsations of the universal One are constant in every dimension in all mass. The thirty trillion per second of a light unit would exactly equal the energy of one super-pulsation of the sun of our solar system. If the energy developed by the ant's in-breathings were stored as potential until its time and mass dimensions were equal to that of the elephant, the pressure thus accumulated would exactly equal the power of one inbreathing of the elephant. Electromagnetic oscillations are always in alternating series of pressure increase and pressure release. They always alternate between heat absorbing and heat releasing, between melting and freezing, between contraction and expansion and between generation and radiation. The oscillating pulsations of the universal force is the basis of the universal power plant. The oscillating swinging of the pendulum between the power of inertia and the equal power of motion is the fundamental principle of universal mechanics. Man cannot conceive any possible mechanical device or principle which will perform work, store energy, or transmit power, which is not founded upon the alternating compression-expansion sequences of universal in breathings and outbreathings. Man cannot use any power other than that given him to use from the universal power-house. Man cannot achieve any success, evolve any idea or create any principle other than that of inducing power from inertia by overcoming it and transforming it into motion against resistance, then carrying it by the effort of mind and body beyond the dead center of opposition. Once carried to this point its motion will reproduce itself and assist his efforts by the accumulated impetus. Page 148 Page 149 CONTENTS CHAPTER IX CONCERNING ENERGY The universe is simple. Truth is simple. The universal constant of energy is back of all motion. It is available for everyone to use according to his desire. All energy is caused by universal thinking. All thinking is universal thinking and all thinking is simultaneous universally. All of the energy of all the universe is back of all thinking, for Mind is all that thinks and there is no variability to the constant of energy which Mind uses in its process of thinking. There is apparent variability of intensity of thinking, but that appearance of variability is due to the concentrative ability of Mind to accumulate a greater or less amount of the universal constant. Exactly as man harnesses accumulated electric potential to perform his work, so may man harness accumulated potential to transform to the low octaves of his outer thinking the inspired idea conceived in the greater speed of the high octaves of his inner thinking. The more electric potential a man can concentrate, the more work he can perform. Similarly the more concentrated is his thinking the greater is his power to create, to command or to do. Concepts are born in the high speeds of the high octaves of inner thinking where speed- time dimension is preponderant. They are then transformed into power-time dimension by resisting the motion established in the concept by the generative action of concentrative thinking. The speed-time concept is thus converted into the illusion of form in accordance with the individual ability of man to apply the resistance brakes which will transform the invisible reality of concept into the visible illusion of form. The varying power of men to achieve because of their varying desire to generate the impetus of a concept into power is also to be found in every particle of matter in the universe. Just as various energies are appropriated by man in accordance with his desire, so are varying energies absorbed by varying particles of matter. Just as a dynamo generates power to perform work so does every mass generate it. Just as the work accomplished by man, or by a dynamo, is proportionate to his, or its ability to generate a dimension of energy sufficient for the work desired, so is the work produced by a mass proportionate to its desire. Every light unit, atomic system, planet, or sun either performs its work by the energy which it generates and by so doing makes its progress through the system in the orderly manner keeping ever in the progressive current, or it degenerates and gets into the opposite flowing stream and retrogresses. It is as characteristic for mass to resist its evolution as it is for man to do so. The desire for the easier way is as strong in one as it is in the other. The lines of least resistance are those which lead back in the magnetic stream to inertia. The pace in the electric stream is swift and hard. Every inch of progress must be earned by the hard work necessary to overcome the inertia of the previous inch. Page 150 Every inch earned must be stabilized by erecting opposing pressure walls to prevent losing the ground gained. The law of the universe of motion is, generate or degenerate, and this applies to every particle in the universe as pitilessly as it does to man. The variable power within matter to per form work or to attract other matter should be taken into consideration in the concepts and laws of gravitation. Gravitation is an expression of energy and its power is variable. Like all effects of motion it has its periodicity which is not controlled by distance, time, mass nor any other one dimension, but by the ability of a mass to accumulate electric potential. The periodicities of gravitation and radiation are in conformity with the ratios of the formula of the locked potentials. Every chemical element has a varying power of action and reaction according to the pressure and plane position which its desire to accumulate potential has earned for it in its wave of energy. There is no variation of the constant of energy even though the appearance of variability is everywhere about us. The appearance of variability of the universal constant is again a matter of dimension of potential, which, in its turn is a matter of position acquired by work. The energy which runs the universe might be likened unto the energy which runs a clock. There is but one force back of the mechanics of a clock and the dimensions of that force are exactly balanced in every wheel. One wheel races very fast and another may seem to stand still. A big, slow moving wheel turns the hands which the little wheel could not move. The little wheel, however, uses the exact amount of energy in its speed-time dimension that the big wheel uses in the power-time dimension, which it has accumulated and exchanged for speed. The little wheel is fast and weak, while the big wheel is slow and powerful. The deer is swift and weak, while the elephant is ponderously slow and powerful. The energy of the former would exactly equal the energy of the latter if the low potential energy of fast speed-time dimension were trans- ferred to the high potential energy of slow power-time dimension. Power is increased mass, increased contraction pressure, decreased volume, decelerated rotation and accelerated revolution. The generation of all energy is accomplished only through the resistance exerted against the direction of the force of any established motion. Resistance to established motion decelerates the speed-time dimension of motion and accumulates potential by accelerating its power-time dimension. X in power-time dimension is the square root of X in speed-time distance-area dimension and its cube root in volume. If the deer desired more power to fight he could acquire it at the sacrifice of ability to cover distance quickly. The speed of the deer is the result of the desire of the deer for speed. If the speed-time dimension of the deer were transformed to power-time dimension, it would be very massive and slow. It would be a creature of different form because of a desire for a different form. Page 151 Page 152 If the energy of the power-time dimension of a speeding bullet were transformed to mass, the bullet would have to weigh several hundred pounds; or if the same activity were transformed to volume it would have to be expanded to several hundreds of feet in diameter. Consider for example the relative power-time dimension of a light unit circling in its atomic orbit probably thirty million times per second as compared with the eleven years consumed by Jupiter in making one revolution in the atom which we call our solar system. The light unit may cover more than one hundred thousand miles per second against Jupiter's eight miles, but the area of the orbit covered by each is exactly equal for equal intervals of time. More than this, the very difference in speed of revolution of a light unit or of a planet, due to the eccentricity of their orbits, is also balanced in the areas covered. Force must be resisted in order to accumulate it into power. To accumulate power is to generate energy by exchanging one time dimension for the other. The high-speed low-power gear wheel of a motor transmission moves slowly while the wheels of the car race very fast. On the contrary the low-speed high-power gear wheel moves very fast and the wheels of the car move very slowly. The high speed-time dimension of the long end of a lever is exactly balanced in the slow speed, accumulated power-time dimension of the short end. Move the fulcrum and both time dimensions change with increase or decrease of power. Change of dimension does not mean change of the universal constant of energy. The resistance to generated energy is registered in heat. The greater the accumulation of energy by generation the greater the temperature registered as a resistance to that accumulation. The greater the generation of energy the greater the radiation. The radiation of all energy is accomplished only by the assistance, exerted in the direction of the force, of any established motion. Assistance to established motion accelerates the speed-time dimension and distributes potential by decelerating its power-time dimension. The heat radiated by the sun is assisted by great pressure back of it and resisted by less pressure ahead of it. Expansion is thereby assisted just as contraction is resisted. Cooling is the result of assistance just as heating is the result of resistance. It cannot be too often repeated that there is no effect of motion in which its opposite effect is not simultaneously present and sequentially preponderant. The word " preponderant " should always be understood in reference to any state of motion. Radiation generates and generation radiates. Expansion is assisted but also it is resisted. The falling water expanding into a cooling spray generates heat by the resistance of the pressures through which it falls. That potential which is being generated must be simultaneously radiated in a less degree, but radiation will eventually become preponderant in its cumulative reaction sequence. The universal constant of energy is never changing. It but appears to change. It is never unbalanced, never out of equilibrium. There is but one force which runs the cosmic clock, and all the wheels of this universe turn with all of the energy of the universe back of each one of them. Page 153 The only difference is one of dimension. Difference of dimension is actuated by the desire of thinking Mind. All of the power of the universe lies in the dimensionless universe of inertia. Work is the principle of the evolving cycles, work of mind and work of body. Work is the principle back of the continuance of the appearance of existence, work born of desire and performed in ecstasy. Without work form cannot hold itself together. Without work reproduction of any accumulated idea would be impossible. Degeneracy of the body begins when physical work relaxes. Degeneracy of the mind begins when concentrative thinking relaxes. Form can only be continued through the effort of sustaining an appearance of stability by creating a progressive series of opposing planes of instability. The effort required of man, or of nature, to do this requires increasing expenditure of energy. Each effort contributes to the next effort. The progress marked by each effort is conditioned by the force of the desire back of that effort. Desire chooses its own dimensions and runs the gait of that desire. All things can be what they desire to be. Desire and effort to be evolves into the reality of that desire. The dimensions of any wave of energy are the dimensions of desire. The accumulation of all potential is the result of a series of explosive actions actuated by the force of desire and stabilized by their reactions. Inertia cannot be overcome, nor motion take place, without the concentrative desire force of the creative, image making faculty of Mind. The universe is apparently divided into a kaleidoscopic complexity of varying energies all of which are exact multiples of the universal constant, as far as first cause is concerned. The variability of these energies depends solely upon desire which alone controls the dimensions of that multiplicity. Power-time dimension is conditioned by restricted area of orbit, decelerated rotation and accelerated revolution, which is nature's method of accumulating high potential. Speed-time dimension is conditioned by expanded area of orbit, decelerated revolution and accelerated rotation which is nature's method of distributing the accumulation into low potential. Potential energy is an accumulation of the energy constant locked in a position of equilibrium by an equal and opposite pressure wall of resistance. It is the breathing spell between effort and effort where the accumulated energy is apparently arrested. Kinetic energy is the generative concentration of effort expended in building new pressure walls of less stability or the degenerative relaxation of effort which allows the pressure walls to expand toward inertia. Kinetic energy is the work performing energy. An interruptive resistance to the flow in either direction will perform work. Work performed by a magnetic stream is a regeneration of energy. It is the conductive stream which the electrician measures in amperes. Resistance to its conductive flow through a wire regenerates energy and reverses discharge into charge. The electric light is a good example of regeneration of degenerating energy. Conversely, work performed by an electric stream is a further generation of energy. Page 154 It is the inductiye stream which the electrician measures in volts. Resistance to its inductive flow through the accumulating plates of a storage battery adds to energy and increases positive charge. High potential energy is generated with increasing pressure resistance which means increasing deceleration of speed-time and an equal acceleration of power-time. One must always balance the other. High potential is generated from low potential against an accumulating pressure resistance equal, in inverse ratio, to the cube of the equilibrium pressure of the low potential, and is degenerated with equal pressure assistance in direct ratio. In other words, doubling the power of a given mass means a decrease in volume and speed of rotation as of the cube of that mass in inverse ratio, or an increase in pressure, temperature and speed of revolution in direct ratio. On the contrary, halving the power for a given mass means an increase in volume in direct ratio, and a decrease in pressure, temperature and speed of revolution in inverse ratio. Every wheel in the cosmic clock runs down in the 4 3 — 2 — 1— ratio of the formula of the locked potentials and is wound up in its 1+ 2+ 3 + 4 ratio. The stopping point of the clock's winding is 4+ beyond which it cannot go and at which point it + must unwind to complete its cycle of motion. Now it is well to return to first cause and look within the cosmic clock itself. Mind is the source of all energy through the dynamic action and reaction of the two opposing pulsations of the process of thinking. All motion begins in the plus, contractive, endothermic impulse of thinking, and ends in the succeeding minus, expansive, exothermic impulse. The entire mechanics of this universe are founded on these two repeative impulses. Every reaction is a balancing sub-normal negative pressure which exactly equals the supernormal positive pressure generated by its opposite action. All inhalation is expressed in contraction and all exhalation in expansion. The entire energy of the universe is expressed through contraction or expansion into super - normal electro - positive or sub - normal electro-negative pressures, each of which un-equalized pressures exerts its utmost efforts to get back into equalized pressures and by so doing performs the work of the universe. By normal pressure is meant any local equilibrium pressure as, for example, the local equilibrium pressure of this planet at sea level. Man is surrounded by all the vast energy of the universe, yet it will not work for him while it is in equilibrium. He must lift its pressure to a higher potential than the horsepower represented by this planet's normal fifteen pounds per square inch sea level pressure, and let it fall into place; or he must lower it below that pressure and allow it to rise into place. Until this is done the vast potential of the planet's local equilibrium pressure is inert and will not perform work. No principle of dynamics can be conceived by man to perform work for him, other than that of restoring potential to its proper place. His engines and his dynamos perform sequences of oscillations between generative contractions to super-normal pressures and radiative expansions to sub-normal ones. If the normal pressure of the surface of this planet could be piped to the surface of Mars, the inhabitants of that planet could have an inexhaustible supply of high potential energy performing work for them, though the same energy will not turn a wheel for us. Page 155 The universal constant of energy is fixed, unalterable and non-variable and its apparent variability is purely an illusion of changed dimensions. The constant of energy represented by a lever is not increased by changing the fulcrum of that lever. If the fulcrum is changed so as to increase the power the speed is decreased in the opposite universal ratio. High power, or high potential, is merely cumulative power-time dimension saved up, stored up, compressed into mass of less relative volume. The high potential of little volume might be likened unto the accumulated energy within a city where the pace is fast and the area small as compared with the same energy spread over a whole state where the pace is slow and the area large. An application of high pressure brakes against the wheels of speed-time expansion dimension will decelerate it with great resistance and convey it into power-time contraction dimension. The cold of expanded speed-time dimension will also reverse itself when so resisted into the generation of much heat. In any mass a change in temperature is in inverse ratio to a change in volume. Generated heat energy will lift a lower potential to a higher one. The higher potential will then have a greater positive charge, and the greater positive charge will increase the concentration of gravitative centers of all mass thus generated, and of all systems affected by the raised potential. All dimensions will change and all pressure walls will shift to accord with the new conditions of new pressures, and then this new potential, born of changed conditions, will have a different appearance and give different reactions. For this reason it will be called another substance. And so, throughout this universe of the One force, the One substance of Mind, man finds many states of motion of varying pressures and varying potentials, and he counts them all up and names them all as separate substances and various energies. Page 156 CONTENTS CHAPTER X ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PRESSURES The construction of the universe in accordance with Euclid's axioms, theorems and postulates is not in accordance with the laws of motion. One of the axioms used by Euclid in proof of other axioms and postulates reads: figures may be freely moved in space without change in shape or size. If this is true the space between the heavenly bodies is a void, a vacuum. If this is true the theory of a non-resistant, pressureless, uniform ether of space is tenable. If this is true the heavenly bodies must hold themselves in their relative orbits by their mutual attraction and the impetus of their motion. If on the contrary it can be clearly shown that figures cannot be freely moved in space without change of size or shape, then a fundamental axiomatic Euclidian principle is not true. It is herein contended that figures cannot move one inch in space without change in shape and size for this entire universe of motion is one of varying, but repeative, pressures. An Euclidian indefinite straight line reaching out to infinity is not possible in this universe of varying pressures. The varying pressures of space are curved. They represent expressions of the energy of motion. All energy of motion expresses itself in waves. All waves are opposed spirals and limited in dimensions. All opposed spiral waves accumulate mass and simultaneously redistribute that accumulation. All accumulating mass is aiming toward gyroscopic perfection of motion and toward perfection of cubic crystallization. All diffusing mass is aiming away from gyroscopic stability, and away from the simple cubic crystallization toward amorphus complexity of crystallization. All direction is the direction of opposing pressures. The direction of all pressures is spiral. All direction is therefore curved. All curves are spiral. All orbits are spiral. They are all conic sections. A parabolic or hyperbolic orbit is impossible in this. universe of pressures. Any anticlockwise orbit which cuts the base of its cone of measured energy is regenerated in the opposed cone of the wave and its orbit becomes a clockwise orbit of another system. An object freely moving in space must move in a curved spiral line whether that object be a planet, a corpuscle, a "ray" of light or any other expression of energy. Further still, any expression of energy in this universe must end where it began. It must be curved. Furthermore the curve is never a circle. It is spiral and its convolutions from its beginning to its ending run the whole gamut of the effects of motion in speeds, temperature, planes and pressures. Furthermore no curved spiral of motion, ending where it began, traverses the universe in its journey. The conclusion of Einstein that the universe must be spherical because all direction is curved is based on the assumption that the direction of motion is curved, circular or elliptical, and traverses the whole universe in its passage. Page 157 No mass, or body or other expression of motion, in any state, can pass the boundary plane of its own wave of energy. Every effort of energy sets its own dimensions. Its boundaries are limited by that effort. Energy reproduces itself and thus transfers its expression throughout the universe from wave to wave, but there are dividing walls where motion ceases and begins again; and where all mass disappears to reform again. Mass is energy. Energy accumulates as mass and is redistributed in accordance with the increasing and decreasing pressures which it is able to generate. A corpuscle is a mass just as a planet is a mass. An atom is a mass just as a solar system is a mass. The pressure which an atom of hydrogen can develop varies vastly from that which an atom of radium can develop. They compare with one another as a sewing machine motor compares with a high voltage power plant. All masses, whether they are light units, planets or suns, are compression and expansion pumps which hold themselves together for a time in greater or less proximity according to the various ratios of their respective compression and expansion powers, in order to simulate the forms being thought out as idea by the image making faculty of the One universal Mind. It is a fundamental principle of physics that the slightest change in pressure of any substance changes its volume. A change of temperature is one indicator of a change of pressure. Every inch of the universe varies in temperature. Every inch must therefore vary in pressure. Every atom varies in pressure from its exterior to its nucleus. If its temperature is changed its volume also 'changes. Also every kind of atom varies from every other kind in volume, temperature and all other dimensions. Every kind of atom is in a different plane and each plane is the pressure wall of one of the varying pressure compartments which divides this universe of motion into pressure zones. "Space" is made up of atoms of these varying pressures. If an object cannot freely move at the earth's surface without expanding or contracting to adjust itself to the varying pressures, how can it do so in space? The answer comes back from tradition; "But space is a void." Is it? It is densely packed with atoms of the high octaves which we cannot see but which are not beyond the power of our instruments to detect even if our thinking cannot reveal them to us. In later volumes the spectroscopic proof of a "space" of motion will be given. For the purpose of this volume let us consider this subject in reference to masses which we can see. We, simple dwellers on this planet, are prone to err in our conclusions because of the relative importance of our planetary position to our point of view. A humming bird flying across our sky is vastly larger than the largest star, and one's hat is apparently bigger than the sun or moon. No wonder that Copernicus made the earth the center of the system upon which all else turned. Page 158 Surely the little village of Kipling's story could be forgiven for voting the world flat as all men once believed. Quite a reasonable human error it was for "one could see it with one's own eyes." There was no illusion about it. It was the most real thing that they knew, a solid thing flat and motionless around which the sky turned. For attempting to correct this error Galileo -narrowly escaped with his life and his statements were almost universally denied. We still measure the orbits of all the planets of this system by our own little earth's ecliptic instead of by the solar equatorial plane. This may be necessary for local convenience just as it is convenient for the village to measure distances to near-by villages and towns from itself. If, however, the geographer or historian mapped the planet or wrote its history around the little village of his residence as a radial center of comparison, he would, to say the least, be colossally egoistic.: The effects of motion of this solar system described herein are based upon the sun as its center and not upon the earth. The planets' :orbits and all precessional motions will also be charted in relation to the solar equatorial plane. All assumed facts of pressure, density, temperature, and the relative power of the attraction of gravitation of this entire solar system, are now measured from conditions obtained in this little pea like village of our solar system without any attempt to translate them into the relative ratios due to relative conditions. If a premise is wrong, a conclusion must be wrong. Hall conclusions regarding temperature, densities and pressures throughout this solar system are herein shown to be founded on wrong premises, they must therefore be wrong. All dimensions are relatively right, but are wrong when measured by units of this planet's standard. Our record of dimensions is in relative ratios. Consider Mercury, a little, heavy, hard planet supposedly less dense than this earth but in reality very much more so. Crushed in the tremendous pressure of close proximity to the great pressure center of this system and just recently taken from the furnace to cool, it slowly wends its spiral way to where Jupiter now is but will not then be. Jupiter is not hard. It could not be. Even with its vast bulk it is not hot as we know heat. Iron would melt there at about 2°.
