It freezes. It becomes what is known as "crystallic." All matter is crystallic. Crystallization is a dimension. It is the first appearance of 'form. Matter registers its energy through temperature dimension of heat and cold in solids of light which man calls "crystals." Crystals are but apparent solids of light sustained in that illusion of appearance by motion. Crystallization is one of the most important dimensions of the illusion of form. Nothing concerning the basic principle or law governing crystalli7ption is known by modern science. It is known by experiment and observation that all elements, or compounds, crystallize in any one of six different classes, but science knows no way of determining crystallic formation, or cleavages, twinning, or other characteristics other than by observation or experiment. In a later volume the fundamental laws underlying crystallization will be charted exactly. In this volume of first principles the basic chart will be reproduced in a brief chapter on "Crystallization." "Solid" matter is frozen light, crystallized by released pressure. The harder it freezes the more solid it appears to be. The slower its motion the harder it freezes. The faster its motion the more quickly it melts. All form of matter has its melting point in temperature at which point matter begins to disappear as form of matter. The more solid matter is, the higher the temperature necessary to melt it. Man's solids are but light retarded in its twelfth dimension, which is axial rotation and sustained in that state of decelerated motion by the energy of gravitation sturdily opposing disintegration. Man's dependable realities are form and dimension. Man's concept of reality is solidity. Solidity is an illusion of dimension. Solids are possible only above certain pressures and below their corresponding temperatures. Page 92 The greater the pressure the higher the freezing point. The lesser the pressure the lower the freezing point. Man's dependable realities are but the "ices" of substances. And so are all things which man knows and sees and feels and stands upon and builds upon, and upon which he relies as true and staunch and real and everlasting. All are but as ice, and, at their respective melting points, as reliable as ice. If this planet did not know a temperature above that which keeps ice solid, man's concept of ice would have as much stability as his concept of granite. If this planet knew a temperature which melted iron the solids would be few and man himself could not be. All solids have their several melting points or points of liquefaction. All solids are liquefied gases and frozen liquids which have their varying liquefaction and freezing points. Freezing points are points of crystallization and vary with the complexity of the elements. All frozen solids can be liquefied by heat. All liquids can be broken into gases by still more heat. Heat radiates. Radiative acceleration is centrifugal. Centrifugal acceleration disintegrates by expansion. All gases can be liquefied by cold and solidified by greater cold. Cold generates. Generative deceleration is centripetal Centripetal deceleration integrates by contraction. Solid ice becomes water at the melting point of ice. Water becomes steam at the vapor point of water. Steam breaks into the gases of water at a still higher temperature. All gases, integrating under gravitative pressures, are complexed by cooling and frozen into appearance. The heretofore invisible gases then become visible solids. All solids are simplified by heat which expands them into disappearance. The heretofore visible solids then become invisible gases. Man's concept of solids is born out of his experiences at the degree of temperature to which he is daily accustomed. This state is limited to about one hundred degrees of the thousands above and the hundreds below man's accustomed temperatures. Man's concept of gold is that of a solid, for man is accustomed to seeing gold at a temperature below its point of crystallization. Man's concept of mercury, is that of a liquid because man is accustomed to seeing it above its point of crystallization. Ice or steam vapor will continually appear and disappear from their source which is water. Matter becomes evident to man when sufficiently integrated in mass to respond to the senses of man as visible solids, liquids and vapors. Solid matter, like time, is only an appearance. Time appears with growth, with day succeeding night, with the seasons and with the sequence of events. Deprive the universe of these hour-glasses of time, and time itself disappears. Matter, in its form dimensions, is an appearance which is the result of motion. Page 93 Deprive the universe of motion, and form of matter disappears. It again resolves itself into the dimensionless substance of matter from which it was born as an appearance. The transforming of the substance of light into matter can be likened unto the transformation of water into ice. The ice is an appearance due to change of motion. The substance of water has not changed. Deprive water of that state of inactivity called "cold" and ice disappears. Again, it may be likened unto the transformation of water into steam. The vapor is an appearance, due to change of motion. The substance of water has not changed. Deprive water of that state of increased activity called "heat" and steam disappears. The substance of matter is eternal, but the appearance of matter in form is fleeting. That which is not eternal will eventually disappear until the swing of the cosmic pendulum will cause its orderly and periodic reappearance. Ice and steam vapor will continually appear and disappear from their source, which is water. States and forms of matter will continually appear and disappear from their source, which is the higher octaves of light. Water has not changed in its apparent transformation into ice or into steam vapor. Light has not changed in its apparent transformation into lower octaves of light, or matter. Nothing has changed; it has but appeared to change. Nothing can change; it can but appear to change. Variance in the dimension of a substance does not change the character of the substance. It but changes its state. Substance cannot change. It can only appear to change through variance in dimension of effects of motion. Just as the spokes of a wheel appear to change into a solid disk when set rapidly in motion so does Mind substance appear to change into a complexity of forms and degrees of apparent solidity in accord with the variable speed of motion of electrically accumulated potential. Also as the dimensions and numbers of the spokes of a wheel give the appearance of greater or less solidity according to the speed of their motion, so do the elements appear more or less solid in accord with the closeness or openness of their orbits and their integration. All of man's elements are the same in substance. Their apparent difference is due to difference in dimension only. Man's concept of substance is the result of his concept of a physical universe of many substances. Man's concept of a spiritual universe is that of a substanceless universe. Man differentiates between the spiritual and the physical universes simply because one responds to his senses and the other does not. When the range of man's senses includes the entire range of light, he will then know that there is no difference between the spiritual and physical except variance in motion, which variance does not constitute a difference in substance. From the high octaves of that which he terms "spirit" to the low octaves of matter and back again to spirit is but a transition from non-appearance to appearance and back to non-appearance. Transition is not change. It is but a journey. From invisibility of substance to visibility and back again to invisibility is not change. It is but an illusion. Creation is but a journey of the thinking Mind of the universal One into the illusions of His divine idea. Page 94 Creation is but a manifestation of God's sublime idea of a universe of space and time and motion. Creation is but a materialization of images thought out during the thinking process of Mind in action. Idea is the sole product of thinking; thinking is the sole purpose of Mind. Man cannot conceive an unthinking or an inactive Mind. Man cannot conceive any other purpose for Mind than that of thinking. Man cannot conceive any other product of Mind than that of idea. If the One substance had not been a thinking substance, the universe would have been without sex force or motion. If it had been a static substance at rest in the perfect equilibrium of uniformity, dynamics would not have been. Without sex, force and motion, appearance and effects could not be. Without appearance dimension could not be. If the universal substance had not been an energized thinking Mind, its composition and attributes would have been uniform through out this dimensionless universe of perfect equilibrium, perfect balance. A static divine Mind, being without energy, would have been non-creative and that which man knows as "creation" would not have been. Without the energy of thinking, Mind would not have had the power to transmute motion into those elements which man calls "matter" or into those forms which man calls "created things." If universal Mind suddenly ceased thinking, all created things would instantly disappear. All form dimensions of matter, deprived of the generative energy of thinking Mind, would instantly become dissociated and deconcentrated and give place to a state of inert dimensionless uniformity. The "created universe" of illusion would disappear. The apparent stability of solids, maintained in their appearance of stability by the equilibrium of motion-in-opposition would instantly give place to the real stability of the One substance, but it would be devoid of light. The universe would immediately become a motionless universe of black, immeasurable cold. It would be without the image making faculty and without intelligence. Its knowledge would be that of mere perception of the reality of existence without the ability to form idea or to conceive it. All dimensions of motion are registered in the minute particles heretofore referred to as light units. As all motion is expressed in waves and registered in form, and as form begins to evolve from the integration of light units, it is well to briefly define the dimension and structure of the light unit in order to correct the misconcept of matter as something apart from life and light and energy. All effects and dimensions of first cause begin with the birth of each light unit. Each point in the universe is the center of the universe. Each point is the beginning and the end of each ten octave swing of the cosmic pendulum. Each new-born corpuscle, or light unit, is a center of disturbance from which the entire universe responds to its alternating electromagnetic pulsations. Motion, once started, never ceases until it has run the entire gamut of the ten octave range, from which point it begins again. The light unit of the highest octave and lowest potential eventually becomes a light unit of the lowest octave and highest potential. Light units are omnipresent throughout the universe. Page 95 All effects of thinking are omnipresent throughout the universe. Nothing is which is not universal. Light units are the beginning and the end of that super-majestic illusion which man calls "creation." They constitute all that man calls "created things," which in truth are creating, evolving things. The creating of these corpuscles is as continuous as thinking is continuous. The concept of man that corpuscles are existent in perpetuity is as wrong a concept as the concept that they are unchanging in their electro-magnetic charges and other dimensions. Reproductive waves of electro-magnetic motion-in-opposition are made up of corpuscles to register, as dimensions in matter, the idea of thinking Mind. Corpuscles are the children of generative energy, born of generative energy and continued by generative energy, even as you and I; and they "die" of old age through lack of it, even as you and I. They are living, thinking 'beings, male and female, even as you and I. They organize and integrate into complex forms of matter through the elements of matter which register the idea of all thinking. Elements of matter are orderly periodic dimensions of the substance of matter. They are living, breathing, pulsing children of light, children of the father-mother substance of Mind, even as you and I. Yes, even as you and I, for of such, and of nothing else, are we composed. Light units are "born" into this universe of illusion as an appearance, registering an idea of thinking Mind, even as you and I. They take their place in complex systems of complexing idea, ever registering the complexing of the idea of thinking. Man is but a complex organization of light-units, functioning under the government of that idea of thinking Mind, called man. Light units exhibit all the characteristics with which man is thoroughly familiar in living organisms. They inhale and exhale, inflating and deflating in the process, just as man does. They generate energy through absorption and lose it through fatigue, just as all life does. All light units and systems of light units are both generative and radiative as all more complex living organizations are both ma le and female. Just as the male of all creating things is both male and female, but preponderantly male, so all light units and systems of light units are both generative and radiative, but preponderantly one or the other. They integrate into form and they disintegrate into the disappearance of form just as all growing things evolve and devolve. They have their periodicities of sleep and wakefulness which is their periodic day just as all life and all mass has its similar periodicities. Also these characteristics are repeated in all multiplicity of light units combined in greater mass Repeativeness is an absolute characteristic of all effects of motion. All mass inhales and exhales, exactly repeating the simple, familiar phases common to all life, for all matter is living matter. The sun inhales and exhales. The five and a half year contraction of the sun to its maximum sun spot period is its inbreathing, and its alternate dilation to its minimum sun spot period is its outbreathing. There is no difference in principle between the breathing of a light unit and that of a giant sun. The only difference in effect is one of dimension. Page 96 The pulsation of a light unit may be thirty trillion to the second, whereas the giant sun may complete one inhalation in five years. Inhalation is for the purpose of continuing the apparent existence of form in matter. Inhalation is regeneration. It is integration. It vitalizes, nourishes, refreshes. It continues that which is known as life. Exhalation is for the purpose of discontinuing the apparent existence of form in matter. Exhalation is dissolution. It is disintegration. It de-vitalizes, exhausts, fatigues. It discontinues that which is known as life and leads ever toward that which is known as death. Light units have the appearance of individuality, even as you and I. There is no individuality in this universe of Mind. There is but an appearance of individuality. This is a universe of the One Thing. That One Thing is Mind. The substance of thinking Mind in action is light. There is but One substance. The One substance cannot be divided into many substances, or many parts. Individuality is but an appearance, an effect of potential in the periodicity of thinking. These little rotating particles of light associate themselves into inter-revolving or gyrating systems which continue the motion given to them by the energy of thinking. These systems are the records of all idea expressed in thinking. They are the living storehouses of the energy of thinking. The energy expended by Mind in the process of thinking idea is not lost or dissipated by thinking. If thinking did not register itself in light and light did not integrate into the forms of idea, the created universe would not be. All thought is registered in these systems of light particles as a means of continuing its evolving appearance of existence as idea, just as man's voice is registered in light particles which reproduce throughout the universe with the speed of light as a means of informing the rest of the universe of man's thinking. Idea of Mind registered in light is living, and through reproduction it continues the idea of itself in its orderly complexing, throughout the entirety of the universal circuit of thinking. These little particles, born of universal thinking in its highest octave, are the first manifestations of what man calls life. They are the first manifestations of the appearance of individual existence. They are the beginning of the appearance of separate existence. They are the beginning of the appearance of opposites. They are the beginning of positive and negative electrical units magnetically united. They are the beginning of male and female individuals. They are the beginning of apparently separate thinking, separate functioning, separate acting, separate living male and female beings. These children of thinking Mind differ in no way from man, or mountain, or oak, or rose, except in their simplicity. They are light: and so is man and the mountain. They think and live and require new energy to generate energy in order to continue their appearance as the beginning of divine idea. They continue themselves as idea by transforming other energy into the idea of themselves. Page 97 They continue others as idea by radiating energy for absorption by others or by being consumed to supply energy for others of which they become a part. Just as the sun continues the idea of itself by transforming other energy into the idea of itself, and just as the sun radiates its energy to continue the idea of this planet by radiation of its energy for absorption by this planet, so does one light unit give to another and take away energy from another. All idea is energy, therefore the energy of one idea can be transformed into the energy of another to continue the idea of that other. All energy is light and all idea is light. One light unit does not destroy another by absorbing it: the one but assimilates the idea of the other. An external unit such as Neptune in our solar system, would not be destroyed by being drawn into the sphere of a new integrating system. The new generative system would reverse Neptune's electro- magnetic charge and make it increasingly generative until some day its journey in a centripetal spiral orbit would end in the hot fires of the central nucleal sun where it would become one with it in energy. Again, in accord with periodic law, would the idea of Neptune be reborn in energy; and once again would it either travel the path of the opening spiral toward nebulosity or the closing spiral path of another new system. Or, if it were not so drawn into another system it would in time disintegrate its mass through expansion and cessation of motion into a negative nebula, and reform through inertia into a positive nebula. All idea is born of the energy of thinking and all idea continues itself as idea by the energy of its thinking. Light units "grow" just as all things grow, and by the same process, the absorption of the energy of other light units. Just as simple idea becomes involved and complex in the thinking, so do light units grow from simplicity to complexity. Radium was once hydrogen; gold was lithium; man was helium; the mountain was silicon; the cooling dew was flaming nitrogen; and all were all of these and all things else. Everything that is, is of everything else that is. Man is but an involved and complex organization of countless myriads of light units assembled into systems, and systems of systems, in the orderly process of continuous thinking of the idea of man. In the complexing of the idea of man, these myriads of light units co-ordinate in order to function in accordance with the evolving idea of man. Each thinking light unit adds to the idea of itself from the source of idea, and all thinking registers itself in new light particles. Just as a growing nation co-ordinates its functions, so does the complexing idea of man co-ordinate its functions. Just as a nation of people divides the work of its units and centralizes its government for the continuation of the idea of itself as a nation, just so does that complex organization called man divide the work of its units and centralize its government in order to continue the idea of itself as man. Man's concept of a thinking brain as the only thinking part of man, is a wrong concept. The brain is but the seat of government of that nation of thinking light units called man. These light units, assembled as a man, think individually but co-ordinate as a unit, and each functions in its place else the idea of the man could not continue. Page 98 Man also thinks individually but co-ordinates as a unit in universal thinking. The individuality of man as a part of the universe is exactly analogous to the individuality of a light unit as a part of man. This is the great law of evolving idea. Idea is evolutionary and continuous; therefore is the recording of idea also continuous. Idea is constantly building itself up in all forming systems. This is integration. This is what man calls growth. It is life. Idea is constantly tearing itself apart. This is disintegration. This is what man calls fading. It is death. Integration and disintegration are simultaneous in all systems. Integration is growth. Fading is growth. Disintegration is life. Death is life. Of this more will be written in its proper place; for it will be more easily understood when the cause of electricity, magnetism and gravitation has been made clear; and also when the laws of magnetic and electric lines of force, which, by their opposition, cause the appearance of that which man calls the "created physical universe of integrating and disintegrating matter," has been clearly written down. Page 99 CONTENTS CHAPTER II ELECTRICITY AND MAGNETISM DEFINITIONS Electricity is the active, attractive force within Mind which appears to concentrate, contract and compress the non-compressible substance of Mind into the forms created by the process of thinking, and to evolve those forms by raising the potential, or power dimension, of energy by accumulation. Magnetism is the reactive, repellant force within the substance of Mind which appears to expand the forms created by Mind in the process of thinking, and to accomplish their dissolution through lowering the potential of energy by releasing the accumulation. Positive electricity is the generative energy of thinking Mind registered in light units which are gravitationally or centripetally resisting magnetic influence by expelling it. The light units are contracting, registering their contraction and their resistance to magnetism in heat. Their electric orbital motion is toward a closing spiral in one plane. Positive electricity is that state of motion in which electricity dominates magnetism. Positive electricity is that state of motion in which centripetal force dominates centrifugal force. Negative electricity is the radiative energy of thinking Mind registered in those same light units which are radially, or centrifugally, yielding to inflowing magnetic influence. They are expanding, registering their yielding and their expansion in cooling, and their electric orbital motion is toward an opening spiral in many planes, culminating in nebulosity. Negative electricity is that state of motion in which magnetism dominates electricity. Negative electricity is that state of motion in which centrifugal force dominates centripetal force. LAWS All mass is both electric and magnetic. All mass simultaneously expresses both opposites of all effects of motion, and each opposite is cumulatively preponderant in sequence. All electro-magnetic mass forms into systems of units which revolve in spiral orbits both centripetally toward and centrifugally away from nucleal centers. All preponderantly charging systems are positive systems. All preponderantly discharging systems are negative systems. All preponderantly contracting systems are positive systems. All preponderantly expanding systems are negative systems. All systems whose spirals are preponderantly closing spirals are positive systems. All systems whose spirals are preponderantly opening spirals are negative systems. All systems of preponderantly lessening volume are positive systems. All systems of preponderantly increasing volume are negative systems. All systems of preponderantly increasing potential are positive systems. All systems of preponderantly lowering potential are negative systems. All preponderantly integrating systems are positive systems. Page 100 All preponderantly disintegrating systems are negative systems. All preponderantly generating systems are positive systems. All preponderantly radiating systems are negative systems. All preponderantly heating systems are positive systems. All preponderantly cooling systems are negative systems. In other words, electricity is the inhalation, or inbreathing generative action while magnetism is the exhalation, or outbreathing radiative reaction. Electricity is the plus half of the One universal force which has apparently divided itself into two forces, and magnetism is the minus half. Electricity and magnetism exist as separate appearances only when opposed. In non-opposition they disappear. They become one. Electricity desires to gather its half together as one force and substance, while magnetism, on the contrary, desires separation into two forces and exerts itself to the utmost to bring about this separation. Electricity accumulates power while magnetism dissipates it. Positive electricity is the plus half of electromagnetically charging light units which are seeking higher pressure zones. Negative electricity is the minus half of electro - magnetically discharging light units which are seeking lower pressure zones. : Pressure zones are those states of increasing density of integration which are caused by the power of positive electricity to attract and to accumulate energy. Electricity is the power force of the universe. Electricity accumulates power into high potential from the universal constant at the sacrifice of one of its time dimensions. Electricity is the force of resistance to the established speed of the universal constant of energy. Magnetism is the speed force, the time force, of the universe. Magnetism dissipates the high potential power dimension and transforms it into time dimension of low potential. Magnetism is the force which works toward a return to the established motion of the universal constant of energy. Electricity and magnetism move in opposite directions, their departure from each other being 180°. Modern science believes the departure of magnetic and electric lines of force to be 90°. This is a wrong interpretation of that illusion of motion. Electricity is the force of gravitation and moves spirally toward the nucleal center of its mass. It moves as though it were starting at the base of a cone and travelling around its surface in an ever- contracting spiral orbit, to its apex. Magnetism is the force of radiation and moves spirally toward the extremity of its mass. It moves as though it were starting at the apex of a cone and travelling around its surface in an ever-expanding orbit, to its base. Electricity is therefore centripetal and its acceleration of orbital speed is in proportion to its distance from its generative center. Magnetism is therefore centrifugal and its deceleration of orbital speed is in proportion to its distance from its generative center. Each force balances itself as well as its opposite force. Electricity is the generative force. Page 101 To generate means to decelerate an established motion in order that it may be accumulated. Magnetism is the radiative force. To radiate means to accelerate an accumulated force in order that the accumulation may be dissipated into its established motion. Electricity and magnetism are not two separate forces, nor are they two separate substances. They are merely two different dimensions of motion. They belong solely to motion and not to substance. Neither are positive electricity and negative electricity two kinds of electricity. A cold piece of solid iron is the result of electric deceleration of the universal constant, and is power accumulated by the formation of closely packed atomic systems and restricted orbits. This cold piece of solid iron will disappear into gases if its atomic systems are accelerated sufficiently to dissipate them by radiation. Positive and negative electricity are but two differing potentials of the same force which must move in opposite directions for reasons which shall be made clear later in this chapter. Positive electricity can become negative and negative can become positive by a reversal of their potentials. They are but relative in accord with their respective pressures. The sound of the human voice, for example, is an electro-positive action. Its radiation into space, or along a wire, is its electro-negative reaction. The reproduction of the voice by radio, or at the other end of the wire is an electropositive reproduction of the negative reaction which is rapidly expanding into the disappearance of lower potentials. The sudden impact of the radiating sound against the higher pressures of higher potentials reverses the process of radiation. Negative, expanding, centrifugal force becomes positive contracting centripetal force and we hear ; the sound again. Electricity is the basis of the atom. Within every atom of the One substance is all the power of the universe. It is dynamic. The dynamic power of Mind is due to the activity of thinking. The dynamic action of universal thinking is the cause of all creation and decreation. Universal thinking is the beginning of all energy. Universal thinking is the foundation of all natural law. All of nature's laws are absolute and periodic effects of their cause, which is the energy of thinking. The "created" universe is but an effect due to the positive, concentrating, generating, integrating energy of the dynamic action impulse of thinking, which, in its turn gives way to the negative, expanding, radiating and disintegrating energy of the dynamic re-action impulse of thinking. The mystery of growth is within the comprehension of the man who knows the orderliness of the opposition between the positive action and negative re-action of the two apparently opposite forces of generation and radiation set up in the process of thinking. All creating things are growing things whether they be giant suns, or violets, or man, or elements, or compounds of elements or the atoms of elements. All growth is simultaneously integrating and disintegrating. In the beginning of all growth integration is preponderant, then in its turn, disintegration dominates. Disintegration begins with integration and continues until it, in turn, becomes the conquering force. Page 102 Death is born in the cradle with life. The alternating pulsations of the process of thinking are controlled by two apparently opposing forces. One of these forces is a generating, integrating force of action, while the other is a reactionary radiating and disintegrating force. One force is that which controls evolution while the other is that which compels dissolution. The word of man for the concentrating, generating and integrating force which controls evolution is "electricity." Electricity is the active, attractive, generative, gravitative, positive principle of creation. All decreation is the radiating,. disintegrating energy of dynamic thinking. The mystery of that which man calls death is within the comprehension of the man who knows the orderliness of radiative thinking. There is no death. Death is but the beginning of life. Decreation is continuous, as thinking is continuous. Decreation is but the degeneration of that which has been generated. It is but the reaction of action. Man's word for this radiating, disintegrating force which compels dissolution is "magnetism." Magnetism is the separative, repelative, radiative, negative principle of creation. Electricity is the vitalizing property of matter. Magnetism is the devitalizing property of matter. Electricity is the father, the male principle of thinking Mind. Magnetism is the mother, the female principle of thinking Mind. Magnetism is born of electricity. Electricity and magnetism are One. That One is the father-mother principle of thinking Mind. Their apparently opposite desires, merged together, make One. They are not two opposite principles, they are but the One dynamic principle. In the entire universe there are no opposites. Each is of the other and is the cause of the other; and the energy of thinking, in which -these two forms are in apparent opposition, is the cause of their apparent separability. Electricity is magnetism revitalized. To be vitalized means to be unequalized, or opposed in relation to surrounding pressures. Magnetism is electricity devitalized. To be devitalized means to be equalized or non-opposed in relation to surrounding pressures. The activity of vitalized force is the desire to attain a state of increased opposition. The inactivity of devitalized force is the inertia of a balanced state of non-opposition. Radiation is but the separative reaction of the cumulative action of generation. Radiation is but the lowering of a higher potential. Radiation is the exact opposite of gravitation which is the raising of a lower potential. Disintegration is but the separative reaction of the cumulative action of integration. Action and its reaction, added together are but one. If Mind were not a thinking substance, both electricity and magnetism would not appear to be opposites. Their apparent opposition is the cause of that complexity which man calls "creation." The father principle of Mind is the electropositive force and the cause of centripetal force of motion. Page 103 Centripetal force is born of decelerative resistance to the established universal constant of energy. The mother principle of Mind is the electronegative force and the cause of centrifugal force of motion. Centrifugal force is born of accelerative returning to the established universal constant of energy. The electro-positive force is that in which electricity dominates magnetism and accumulates power by transforming speed into power. The electro-negative force is that in which magnetism has conquered electric opposition and by doing so has released power, by means of expansion, into lower potential of greater speed. The desire of electricity is expressed as action in motion-in-opposition. The desire of magnetism is expressed as the reaction of action in motion-in-inertia. The active force is the positive force. It is the force which stands for what man calls "power", or high potential. The reactive force is the negative force seeking a state of negation, which stands for what man calls "weakness," or low potential. The active force is the creative force of the universe. The reactive force is the decreative force of the universe. The active force is the integrative, generative force of the universe. The reactive force is the disintegrative, degenerative force of the universe. The active force is male, the father force of the universe. The reactive force is female, the mother force of the universe. The creative force is the dynamic, expressive force of thinking which gives apparent form to all idea of thinking Mind. The decreative force is the passive force of thinking which causes the disappearance of form from actuality into potentiality. The father force is the positive force. The mother force is the negative force. The father-mother force united is the reproductive force. The mother force is born of the father force. It is merely its negative reaction. Reaction is opposed to action, not attracted to it. Reaction leaps away from action, not toward it. If reaction, which is negative, leaps away from action, which is positive, then the theory of positive and negative electric charges attracting each other has no foundation. Reaction is born of action. So then, is negative force born of positive force. As magnetic flow is but the reaction of generation, therefore magnetism is born of electricity. The greater the action of generation, the greater the reaction of degenerative magnetic flow. Magnetic flow is radiation. Radiation is the emanation expelled from electro-generative, contractive action. It is the outgoing breath, the exhalation of the living corpuscle, or system, or mass. Radiation is degeneration. The creating universe is, a generating one. The decreating universe is a degenerating one. The generating universe of solid matter is an accumulation of tenuous matter. Generating is charging. The degenerating "physical" universe is a disappearing from the appearance of solidity through states of tenuosity to disappearance. Degeneration is discharging. Page 104 Generation is the winding of the cosmic clock for the accumulation of one time dimension. Degeneration is its unwinding by the release of the other stored up time dimension. Radiation is radiative activity. Modern science calls it :,`radio-activity." Radio-activity is merely the reversing of the time dimensions of the universal constant. It is the exothermal, exhalation of the One universal Being, of which every existing thing is. The more positive the system or mass, the more genero-active and radio-active is that system. The more generative the system or mass, the more cohesive it is. Cohesion is born of generative decelerative, gravitative, centripetal force. The more radiative the system or mass, the less cohesive it is. The more cohesive the system, or mass, the more compact it is. It is what man describes as "harder," which means more impenetrable. The atoms of all of the hard and closely integrated elements have ejected magnetism with greater speed and in smaller streams than the atoms of the less closely integrated elements. Resistance to integration is the cause of this increased speed, and the contracted atomic volume is the cause of the smaller magnetic stream. It is as though a certain volume of water, which has been pumped through a four-inch pipe, had to be pumped through a one-inch pipe in the same amount of time. To do this, the pressure behind that volume of water would have to be vastly increased and the speed of the smaller stream would also have to be vastly increased. Resistance to integration has generated much heat which in its turn has been radiated, thus reversing the magnetic pressure from the magnetic field within the system to the magnetic orbit outside of the system. This process has gradually cooled the systems by the pressure release from within and the consequent radiation of their heat, and allowed them to become more densely packed so that their more closely rotating units could create the illusion of solidity or hardness. Hardness is due to deceleration of rotation and acceleration of revolution which allows a closer integration of light units in their systems. It might be said, concerning the illusion of solidity, that if a cobweb could be woven with sufficient density and revolved with sufficient rapidity, it would appear to be a solid disk of silver. Genero-activity is the opposite of radioactivity. Genero-activity is the resistance set up against one time dimension of the universal constant in order to transform it into power. It is the endothermal inhalation of the One universal Being. The positive force of motion-in-opposition is that which produces all idea of thinking Mind and gives it the appearance of form. The negative force of motion-in-opposition is that which tears apart the appearance of form and carries the soul of it, or the memory of it, back into motion-in-inertia. The union of these positive and negative forces of motion-in-opposition reverses radiative dominance to generative dominance and thus causes a reproduction of the idea and the form of the idea through re-integration. The positive electric force is the creating force. The negative electric force is the decreating force. The union of positive and negative is the reproducing force. Reproduction means the re-integration of form back into that octave in which it has once appeared, but from which it has disappeared by disintegration into motion-in-inertia. In motion-in-inertia the soul of all idea awaits regeneration. Page 105 The soul of all idea is registered in the seed of idea. In the seed of man is the whole of man, and so also the seed of all idea. All idea and all form of idea is electrically conceived and electrically evolved to its highest limitations of potential. It then becomes magnetically dissipated and devolved to its lowest potential. The desire of electricity is divisibility of the indivisible Mind substance into parts. Electricity craves separation from magnetism. Electricity desires itself alone and shares company with magnetism only because it is fatigued by resisting it. Electricity would tear the Mind substance apart in its desire to materialize divine idea into • form. It would make of this universe one solid non-elastic mass if its desire could be gratified. Now it must be remembered that the substance of Mind is a perfect, homogeneous, indivisible one. Electricity cannot separate from magnetism and its attempts to do so give only the appearance of separation into parts. Magnetism does not desire companionship or union with electricity, nor does it desire its own continuation as a separate force. It desires to extinguish electricity as a separate force by separating its particles. Its own extinction would be the consequence of the gratification of this desire. Magnetism desires an equilibrium of motion and absolute inertia, while electricity desires action, and is not concerned with the reaction which adjusts that action in an equilibrium of motion-in- opposition. The force of electricity is the generative, centripetal force of contraction into the appearance of form. It is the opposite of the reactive force of magnetism which is the force of radiative, centrifugal expansion into the disappearance of form. Evolving matter, or idea, or form, is electrically preponderant. This means that positive charge predominates. Devolving matter, or idea, or form, is magnetically dominant. This means that negative charge predominates. Evolving appearance of form in matter is a periodic integration, due to positive-electromagnetic opposition, in which the generative force of electricity is preponderant. That which man calls "growth" is merely periodic integration, during which the generative force of positive electricity is preponderant. Devolving disappearance of matter is a periodic disintegration, due to negative-electromagnetic opposition in which the radiative force of magnetism is dominant. That which man calls ageing, or fading, or declining, is merely periodic disintegration, during which time generation continues, but with lessened energy, for the radiative force of magnetism is dominant. The vigor of youth is due to electric preponderance and the weakening of adolescence is due to magnetic dominance. Youth, the growing period, is the life inhalation period. It corresponds to the first five octaves of the universal ten octave cycle. Maturity is the turning point of the life inhalation period toward its life exhalation period. It corresponds to carbon, the turning point of the universal ten octave cycle. Ageing is merely the life exhalation period. It corresponds to the last five octaves of the universal ten octave cycle. Page 106 Electricity is always preponderant in all dimensions, but it is both preponderant and dominant in the positive half of the reproductive wave of the universal energy constant. Magnetism is never preponderant but it is dominant in the negative half of the universal energy constant. Youth is preponderantly generative, or power accumulative. Age is dominantly radiative, or power releasive. Youth is preponderantly electro-positive, or integrative. Age is dominantly electro-negative, or disintegrative. The perfume of the budding rose is a disintegration of the preponderantly generating, growing rose, but because of electric preponderance, integration so exceeds disintegration that growth continues despite that disintegration until both forces are equalized in which man calls "death." Just as soon as the gravitative forces of electro-positive preponderance have carried the growth of that rose to the fourth gravitational tone of electro-magnetic opposition, which is the maximum point of inhalation in its life cycle, then magnetism begins to dominate and the rose begins to fade. Just so with all integrating idea, whether it be man, or planet, or flaming sun, or minute atomic system. The law for one is the law for all. Death is a disappearance of form, but not of the idea of that form. Growth is an effect of gravitation. Growth means that forming things pass down the octaves in gravitative periodicity. During that periodicity, electricity gives form to the idea and magnetism gradually nebulizes that form back into idea. The form of idea is of no import, it is but a manifestation of the idea itself. Form is fleeting. Its appearance and disappearance are periodically repeative throughout eternity. Idea is the eternal record of form, the soul of form. Out of motion-in-inertia comes a new-born idea which runs the course from .electro-positive motion-in-opposition into electronegative motion-in-opposition and back again into motion-in-inertia. There it is stored as the chemical registration of the idea, which man calls "memory," until man needs to recall it again.
